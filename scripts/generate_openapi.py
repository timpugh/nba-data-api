"""Generate the OpenAPI spec for the Hello World API.

Imports the Lambda resolver, calls get_openapi_json_schema() on it, and writes
the result to docs/openapi.json. Runs as a pre-build step for Zensical via
the ``docs`` Make target, so the rendered API reference always reflects the
routes and Pydantic models currently in the code.

After Powertools generates the vanilla OpenAPI 3 spec, a small post-processor
injects a uniform ``x-amazon-apigateway-integration`` block onto every
operation so readers can see the AWS wiring in the published spec, not just
the HTTP interface. The integration URI uses literal placeholders
(``{region}``, ``{lambdaArn}``) — callers who want to import the spec into
their own API Gateway substitute those for real values first. The actual
deployed API is built by CDK in ``HelloWorldApp``; this spec is
documentation-only.

The spec is intentionally generated at build time rather than served at
runtime: exposing it via API Gateway would publish the full API surface to
any caller, which we do not want for a reference service.

DESCRIPTION = """\
Reference serverless API built on AWS Lambda Powertools, deployed behind
API Gateway, CloudFront, and AWS WAF.

The spec on this page is generated at documentation-build time from the
live Pydantic models and route decorators in `lambda/app.py`. Any change
to a route, a request body model, or a return-type annotation appears
here on the next `make docs` run.

Each operation carries an `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` block showing
the AWS_PROXY integration with Lambda that the CDK stack provisions. The
URI uses literal `{region}` and `{lambdaArn}` placeholders — the deployed
API is built by CDK, not imported from this file, so readers can substitute
those if they want to `aws apigateway import-rest-api` the spec elsewhere.
