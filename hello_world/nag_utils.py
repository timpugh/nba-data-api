"""Shared cdk-nag helpers.

``apply_compliance_aspects`` applies the full available rule-pack set to a
stack so every stack exercises the same compliance gauntlet. NIST 800-53 R4
is intentionally omitted — R5 supersedes it and running both would duplicate
findings on overlapping controls.

``CDK_LAMBDA_SUPPRESSIONS`` is the canonical suppression list for CDK-managed
singleton Lambdas (AwsCustomResource provider, BucketDeployment, S3AutoDeleteObjects).
Their runtime, memory, tracing, DLQ, VPC, and IAM policies are all managed by
CDK and cannot be configured by the caller. Import it and pass it to
``NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions_by_path`` or
``NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions`` with ``apply_to_children=True``.
