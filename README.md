This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the AWS CDK. It includes the following files and folders.

- `app.py` - CDK entry point; instantiates the WAF, backend, and frontend stacks and calls `app.synth()`
- `lambda/` - Code for the application's Lambda function
- `hello_world/hello_world_stack.py` - The backend CDK stack — a thin wrapper that composes `HelloWorldApp`, applies cdk-nag Aspects, and wires CfnOutputs
- `hello_world/hello_world_app.py` - `HelloWorldApp` construct — owns the domain resources (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SSM, AppConfig, monitoring)
- `hello_world/hello_world_waf_stack.py` - The WAF stack (CloudFront-scoped WebACL, always in `us-east-1`)
- `hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py` - The frontend stack (S3 + CloudFront)
- `hello_world/nag_utils.py` - Shared cdk-nag rule-pack helper (`apply_compliance_aspects`) and suppression list for CDK-managed singleton Lambdas
- `frontend/` - Static assets (`index.html`) deployed to the frontend S3 bucket
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared test fixtures (API Gateway event, Lambda context, mocks)
- `docs/` - Zensical documentation source files
- `pyproject.toml` - Consolidated tool configuration (ruff, mypy, pylint, pytest, coverage)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook definitions (runs on every `git commit`)
- `.bandit` - Bandit security scanner configuration (excluded directories)
- `.vscode/` - VS Code workspace settings and recommended extensions (ruff, mypy, pylint, pytest)
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `docs.yml`, `dependency-audit.yml`, `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`)
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependabot configuration (weekly checks for GitHub Actions and all three Python requirements tiers)
- `Makefile` - Common development commands (`make help` to list all targets)
- `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0 license
- `TODO.md` - Outstanding work and deferred items

This application provisions Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SSM Parameter Store, AppConfig, CloudFront (S3-backed), and WAF — split across three stack files in `hello_world/` (`hello_world_stack.py` for the backend, `hello_world_waf_stack.py` for WAF, `hello_world_frontend_stack.py` for S3/CloudFront). The Lambda function uses [AWS Lambda Powertools](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/) for logging, tracing, metrics, routing, idempotency, parameters, and feature flags — see [Lambda Powertools features](#lambda-powertools-features). Note that Powertools Tracer currently depends on `aws-xray-sdk`, which is approaching deprecation; there's an [open RFC](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda/discussions/90) to migrate to OpenTelemetry.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — needed to install the CDK CLI (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
* [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting-started.html)
* [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) — used by `aws logs tail` for streaming Lambda logs and shared by the CDK CLI for credentials
* [Python 3.13+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Python package and environment manager (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
* A container runtime for bundling Lambda dependencies — either:
  * [Finch](https://runfinch.com/) — AWS-supported, open-source, license-friendly (recommended)
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) — drop-in alternative; CDK uses it by default when `CDK_DOCKER` is unset

### Quick start

Just want to explore the code and run tests without deploying anything to AWS?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timpugh/lambda-powertools-reference.git
cd lambda-powertools-reference
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
make install
make test
```

No AWS credentials or deployed stack required — unit tests mock all external dependencies.

If you open the project in VS Code, the `.vscode/` directory pre-configures ruff (format on save), mypy, pylint, and pytest against `pyproject.toml`. The first time you open it, VS Code will prompt you to install the recommended extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

### Makefile

Common commands are available via `make`. Run `make help` to see all targets:

```bash
make install            # set up both venvs (.venv + .venv-lambda) and pre-commit hooks
make doctor             # diagnostic snapshot — uv/cdk/drawio versions, venv state, pre-commit wiring
make test               # run unit tests with coverage (in .venv-lambda)
make test-cdk           # run CDK stack assertion tests (in .venv)
make test-integration   # run integration tests (requires deployed stack)
make lint               # run all pre-commit hooks (ruff, mypy, pylint, bandit, xenon, pip-audit)
make format             # format code with ruff
make typecheck          # run mypy in both venvs (CDK side in .venv, Lambda runtime + scripts in .venv-lambda)
make security           # run bandit (direct) + pip-audit (via pre-commit so the CVE ignore list stays single-sourced)
make cdk-synth          # synthesize all stacks (with '**' glob so cdk-nag descends into Stage-nested stacks)
make cdk-notices        # show AWS-published CDK notices (CVEs, deprecated CDK versions, breaking changes)
make cdk-deprecations   # list deprecated CDK APIs in use (synth output filtered for "deprecated")
make deploy             # cdk deploy '**' --require-approval never (us-east-1; pass `-c region=X` for others)
make destroy            # cdk destroy '**' (interactive confirmation; pass --force to skip)
make docs               # build Zensical HTML docs
make docs-open          # build and open docs in browser
make docs-serve         # regenerate OpenAPI + start Zensical dev server with hot reload
make lock               # regenerate uv.lock and lambda/requirements.txt from pyproject.toml
make upgrade            # upgrade all dependencies (respects COOLDOWN_DAYS, default 7)
make deps-merge         # process every open Dependabot PR (rebase + lock + push + arm auto-merge); use PR=N for one
make clean              # remove build artifacts, caches, and coverage files (preserves venvs)
make clean-venvs        # wipe .venv and .venv-lambda (separate from `clean` — reinstalling takes minutes)
```

**Virtual environments are project-local.** Both `.venv` (CDK workstation) and `.venv-lambda` (Lambda runtime) live at the repo root, are gitignored, and are created automatically by `make install`. You do not pick the location — `uv` does, based on the directory `make` runs from. Each clone of this repo gets its own pair; nothing is shared across projects on disk. The `attrs` version conflict between CDK (requires `attrs<26` via jsii) and Powertools (requires `attrs>=26`) is the reason two venvs exist; both resolutions are recorded in one `uv.lock` via `[tool.uv.conflicts]` in `pyproject.toml`. The Makefile's `LAMBDA_ENV := UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-lambda` variable + `$(LAMBDA_RUN)` prefix mean every target that needs Powertools auto-switches without an activation dance.

Run `make doctor` after `make install` to confirm both venvs picked up the expected groups (`aws-cdk` in `.venv`, `aws-lambda-powertools` in `.venv-lambda`), and to verify `cdk` / `drawio` CLIs are on `PATH` and that pre-commit is wired into `.git/hooks/`. If a venv ever ends up corrupted (lockfile resolver refuses to reconcile, Python version mismatch, mysteriously-missing modules), `make clean-venvs && make install` is the cheapest path back to a known-good state.

### Editor setup (VS Code)

The repo keeps two Python environments due to the `attrs` version conflict (`.venv` for CDK, `.venv-lambda` for Lambda runtime — see [Project dependencies](#project-dependencies)).

**Recommended: open the workspace file.** `File > Open Workspace from File…` → `practice.code-workspace`. The workspace declares four folder roots — `.` (CDK + `.venv`), `lambda/` (`.venv-lambda`), `tests/unit/` (`.venv-lambda`), `scripts/` (`.venv-lambda`) — each with its own `python.defaultInterpreterPath` in `.vscode/settings.json`. The effect:

- **Pylance** spins up a separate instance per root, so CDK code resolves `aws_cdk` against `.venv` and Lambda code resolves `aws_lambda_powertools` against `.venv-lambda` simultaneously — no red squiggles on either side.
- **Terminals** opened from each root auto-activate that root's venv.
- **Test Explorer** runs unit tests under `.venv-lambda` and CDK tests under `.venv` independently.

**Fallback: open the folder directly.** `File > Open Folder` defaults to `.venv` (CDK side fine, but Powertools imports in `lambda/` show as unresolved due to Pylance's single-interpreter-per-workspace limit). Use only if you specifically don't want the workspace file loaded.

[VS Code's `python-envs.pythonProjects`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_python-projects) would handle terminal activation and test discovery per folder inside a single workspace, but it assumes each project's venv lives under its folder. This repo keeps both venvs at the repo root (matching uv's `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` layout), so the multi-root workspace is the right fit. Pylance is single-interpreter per workspace anyway — multi-root is the only way to get correct type resolution for both sides.

**Settings worth knowing:**

- `python-envs.workspaceSearchPaths` is pinned to `["./.venv", "./.venv-lambda"]` so the *Python: Select Interpreter* picker lists both. The default `./**/.venv` misses `.venv-lambda` because it matches only the literal name. Append to the array if you add a third venv.
- `python-envs.alwaysUseUv` is *user-scoped* (cannot be committed). Set it to `true` to create new envs via `uv venv` instead of `python -m venv` — worth turning on since the Makefile already uses uv.
- `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode: "strict"` runs full Pylance type analysis inline. This **overlaps** with the mypy linter (which runs on save and in CI) but they're separate engines: Pylance is stricter on `Any` and inferred narrowing, mypy catches different things. If too loud, lower to `"basic"`/`"off"` in User Settings.
- `autoImportCompletions`, `autoFormatStrings`, and the full set of `inlayHints` (`variableTypes`, `functionReturnTypes`, `callArgumentNames: "all"`, `pytestParameters`) are all on. Tune `callArgumentNames` to `"partial"` in User Settings if dense call sites get noisy.

**Debug configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`)** — three F5 configs pre-wired:

- **Python: Current File** — generic debugpy launch on the focused `.py` file.
- **Pytest: Current File** — runs `pytest ${file} -v --override-ini=addopts=` under the debugger. `--override-ini=addopts=` strips the global pytest options (`-n auto`, `--cov-fail-under=100`, HTML reporter) that would otherwise fight the debugger, fail single-test runs on the coverage threshold, or suppress breakpoints (a known `pytest-cov` issue). Tagged `"purpose": ["debug-test"]` so the Test Explorer's debug-icon uses this config too.
- **CDK: Synth (app.py)** — runs the CDK entry point under debugpy with the dummy-account env vars the `cdk-check` CI job uses. Useful when synth blows up — set a breakpoint in any `*_stack.py`, hit F5, walk the stack assembly.

### Lambda Powertools features

The Lambda function in `lambda/app.py` uses the following Powertools utilities:

#### Logger
Structured JSON logging with `@logger.inject_lambda_context`. Automatically includes Lambda context fields (function name, request ID, cold start) in every log entry. Configured via `POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME` and `POWERTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variables. The legacy `LOG_LEVEL` fallback is intentionally not set — running both side-by-side hides which knob actually wins.

#### Tracer
X-Ray tracing with `@tracer.capture_lambda_handler` on the entry point and `@tracer.capture_method` on route handlers. Creates subsegments for each traced method.

#### Metrics
CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) via `@metrics.log_metrics(capture_cold_start_metric=True)`. The `/hello` route emits a `HelloRequests` count metric. Metrics are published under the `HelloWorld` namespace (set via `POWERTOOLS_METRICS_NAMESPACE`).

#### Event Handler
`APIGatewayRestResolver` provides Flask-like routing with `@app.get("/hello")`. It parses the API Gateway event and routes to the correct handler based on HTTP method and path.

The resolver is constructed with `enable_validation=True`, which turns on Pydantic-based request and response validation driven entirely by function type annotations. The return-type annotation on the `hello()` handler is a `HelloResponse(BaseModel)` — Powertools validates the returned object against that model and serializes it to JSON. Adding request bodies later is the same pattern: declare a Pydantic model as a parameter type and it gets validated and documented automatically.

#### Idempotency
The `@idempotent` decorator uses a DynamoDB table to prevent duplicate processing of the same request. It keys on `requestContext.requestId` and records expire after 1 hour. The CDK stack provisions the DynamoDB table with PAY_PER_REQUEST billing and a TTL attribute.

#### Parameters
`get_parameter()` fetches the greeting message from SSM Parameter Store. The parameter path is set via the `GREETING_PARAM_NAME` environment variable. Values are cached automatically by Powertools to reduce API calls.

#### Feature Flags
`FeatureFlags` reads from AWS AppConfig to toggle behavior at runtime. The `enhanced_greeting` flag controls whether the response includes extra text. The CDK stack provisions the AppConfig application, environment, configuration profile, and an initial hosted configuration version.

#### OpenAPI spec (build-time, not runtime)
The Pydantic models and route hints that power `enable_validation=True` also drive an OpenAPI 3 spec. `scripts/generate_openapi.py` imports the Lambda resolver at **docs-build time**, calls `app.get_openapi_json_schema(...)`, writes `docs/openapi.json`, and `docs/api.html` renders it in-browser via [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar)'s standalone bundle. Zensical copies both files into the built site verbatim.

The script then runs a post-processor that attaches a uniform `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` (AWS_PROXY) extension to every operation, with literal `{region}` and `{lambdaArn}` placeholders for `aws apigateway import-rest-api`. The deployed API is always built by CDK, so the extensions are **documentation-only**, showing the AWS wiring in context. Per-route customisation would drift from CDK — the actual source of truth.

The injection is automatic: any new route (`@app.post("/greet")`, `@app.delete("/hello/{id}")`) picks up the extension on the next `make docs` run. Only verbs outside the standard set (`get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`, `options`, `head`, `patch`, `trace`) would be skipped — not realistic for a REST API.

The spec is intentionally **not** exposed at runtime. A public `/openapi.json` hands unauthenticated callers a map of every path and field name. Keeping it a build artifact gives callable-facing docs without leaking the schema. `make docs` regenerates the spec and rebuilds Zensical in one step, so the rendered API reference is always current.

#### Event Source Data Classes
`APIGatewayProxyEvent` provides typed access to the incoming API Gateway event. Instead of raw dict access like `event["requestContext"]["identity"]["sourceIp"]`, you get `event.request_context.identity.source_ip` with IDE autocomplete and type safety. Powertools includes data classes for many event sources:

- `APIGatewayProxyEvent` / `APIGatewayProxyEventV2` — REST and HTTP API events
- `S3Event` — S3 bucket notifications
- `SQSEvent` — SQS messages
- `DynamoDBStreamEvent` — DynamoDB stream records
- `EventBridgeEvent` — EventBridge events
- `SNSEvent`, `KinesisStreamEvent`, `CloudWatchLogsEvent`, and more

These are available from `aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.data_classes` and require no extra dependencies.

### AWS resources provisioned

Resources are split across three stacks. All resources in all stacks have `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` so `cdk destroy` leaves nothing behind.

**`HelloWorldWaf-{region}`** (always in `us-east-1`):

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| WAF WebACL | CloudFront-scoped WebACL with 4 managed rule groups (IP reputation, common rule set, known bad inputs, anonymous IPs) + forwarded-IP rate limit |
| KMS Key | Encrypts the WAF log group |
| CloudWatch Log Group (`aws-waf-logs-*`) | Receives WAF access logs |

**`HelloWorld-{region}`** (backend, target region):

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| KMS Key | Encrypts all log groups and DynamoDB |
| Lambda Function | Runs the hello-world handler (256 MB, arm64/Graviton, X-Ray tracing, JSON logging, env vars CMK-encrypted) |
| CloudWatch Log Group | Lambda log group with 1-week retention, KMS-encrypted |
| API Gateway REST API | Exposes `GET /hello` with X-Ray tracing |
| CloudWatch Log Group (access) | API Gateway access logs (16-field JSON), KMS-encrypted |
| CloudWatch Log Group (execution) | API Gateway execution logs, KMS-encrypted |
| DynamoDB Table | Idempotency records (TTL, PAY_PER_REQUEST, PITR, KMS-encrypted, Contributor Insights enabled) |
| SSM Parameter | Greeting message (CDK-generated name, read via the `GREETING_PARAM_NAME` env var) |
| AppConfig Application | Feature flag configuration |
| AppConfig Environment | `{stack}-env` environment for feature flags |
| AppConfig Configuration Profile | `{stack}-features` profile with `AWS.AppConfig.FeatureFlags` type |
| Resource Group + Application Insights | CloudWatch Application Insights monitoring |
| CloudWatch Dashboard | Lambda, API GW, DynamoDB metrics via cdk-monitoring-constructs |
| Custom Resource (`AppInsightsDashboardCleanup`) | Deletes the Application Insights auto-created dashboard on destroy |

**`HelloWorldFrontend-{region}`** (frontend, target region):

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| KMS Key | Encrypts the frontend S3 bucket and auto-delete Lambda log group |
| S3 Bucket (frontend) | Private static assets, KMS-encrypted, server access logging enabled |
| S3 Bucket (access logs) | Receives S3 server access logs (`s3-access-logs/`), CloudFront standard access logs (`cloudfront/`), and Athena query results (`athena-results/`). SSE-S3 — log delivery requires it. 7-day expiration lifecycle rule applied to all prefixes |
| S3 Bucket (CloudTrail logs) | Stores CloudTrail data-event records, separate from the audited buckets to avoid feedback loops |
| CloudTrail Trail | Records every Get/Put/Delete object-level call against the frontend and access-log buckets, KMS-encrypted, file-validation enabled, with CloudWatch Logs integration |
| CloudFront Distribution | HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2+, WAF-protected, SECURITY_HEADERS policy, access logging to S3 |
| CloudWatch Log Group (auto-delete) | Auto-delete Lambda log group, KMS-encrypted |
| Glue Database | Catalog database for CloudFront and S3 access log analytics |
| Glue Table (`cloudfront_logs`) | 33-field tab-delimited schema for CloudFront standard access logs |
| Glue Table (`s3_access_logs`) | 26-field regex-parsed schema for S3 server access logs |
| Athena WorkGroup | Query execution config with SSE-KMS encrypted results (per-object override on the SSE-S3 bucket), CloudWatch metrics enabled |
| Athena Named Queries (5 CloudFront + 6 S3) | Pre-built SQL queries: top URIs, errors, top IPs, bandwidth by edge, cache hit ratio, top operations, error requests, top requesters, slow requests, access denied (403), object read audit |
| CloudWatch RUM AppMonitor | Real User Monitoring for the browser — page loads, JS errors, Core Web Vitals, fetch timings, user interactions, with X-Ray correlation |
| Cognito Identity Pool | Unauthenticated identity pool issuing guest credentials to the browser RUM client |
| IAM Role (RUM guest) | Assumed by the identity pool; scoped to `rum:PutRumEvents` on this app monitor only |

### Stack and construct composition

The project follows the CDK best practice ["model with constructs, deploy with stacks"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html): domain resources live inside reusable `Construct` subclasses, each `Stack` is a thin wrapper composing them and applying stack-wide concerns (Aspects, CfnOutputs, nag suppressions).

- [`HelloWorldApp`](hello_world/hello_world_app.py) (`Construct`) owns the KMS key, DynamoDB table, SSM parameter, AppConfig app, Lambda function, API Gateway, Application Insights, dashboard, Logs Insights saved queries, and per-resource cdk-nag suppressions.
- [`HelloWorldStack`](hello_world/hello_world_stack.py) (`Stack`) instantiates `HelloWorldApp(self, "App")`, calls `apply_compliance_aspects(self)`, wires CfnOutputs, attaches stack-level and singleton-scoped suppressions.

The WAF and frontend stacks are small enough (single logical unit each) to keep their resources inline — the construct-extraction pattern is demonstrated on the backend as the reference example.

The three stacks are then composed into [`HelloWorldStage`](hello_world/hello_world_stage.py), a [`cdk.Stage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html). A Stage groups stacks always deployed together, scopes synthesis under `cdk.out/assembly-{stage}/`, and is the natural boundary for CDK Pipelines. `stack_name=` is set explicitly inside the Stage so CloudFormation names stay as `HelloWorld-{region}` — without the override, the Stage ID would be prepended.

**Generated vs. physical resource names.** Following the ["use generated resource names"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html) best practice, `table_name`, `parameter_name`, and `log_group_name` are left unset on the DynamoDB table, SSM parameter, Lambda log group, and API Gateway access log group — CDK auto-generates unique names from the construct path. This prevents (1) replacement-style schema-change failures from pinned physical names and (2) regional-deployment name collisions. Explicit names are retained only where AWS requires them: the API Gateway execution log group (`API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{api-id}/{stage}` is service-fixed), the WAF log group (`aws-waf-logs-*` prefix is enforced), and the AppConfig L1 constructs (no auto-generation option via CDK).

### Frontend stack

The frontend is split across `HelloWorldWafStack` and `HelloWorldFrontendStack`, decoupled from the backend so it can be deployed and destroyed independently — and to demonstrate the standard CDK multi-stack and cross-region reference patterns.

```
Browser → CloudFront → S3 (private bucket)
               ↓
        WAF WebACL (us-east-1, always)
```

The browser calls `GET /hello` directly against the API Gateway URL — CloudFront only serves static assets, it does not proxy API requests.

#### Three-stack design and cross-region support

WAF lives in its own stack because CloudFront-scoped WAF WebACLs are an AWS hard requirement to exist in `us-east-1`, regardless of where other resources live. Isolating WAF lets the backend and frontend deploy to any region without duplicating the WAF or violating the constraint. Each regional deployment gets three independently named stacks:

| Stack | Region | Contents |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `HelloWorldWaf-{region}` | Always `us-east-1` | WAF WebACL with all rules |
| `HelloWorld-{region}` | Configurable | Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SSM, AppConfig |
| `HelloWorldFrontend-{region}` | Configurable | S3, CloudFront (references WAF ARN) |

```bash
cdk deploy --all                                 # us-east-1 (default)
cdk deploy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1        # Singapore — WAF stays in us-east-1
cdk destroy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1       # tears down only the Singapore stack set
```

CDK wires the WAF ARN across regions automatically; other regional deployments are unaffected.

> **WAF cost note.** Each regional deployment provisions its own $5/month WAF WebACL. For a reference architecture, deployment independence is the right default. A production setup with multiple long-lived environments could share one `HelloWorldWaf` stack and pass its ARN to each frontend stack — intentionally deferred here.

#### How cross-region references work

CloudFormation outputs only work within a single region, so CDK uses `cross_region_references=True` on the frontend stack to bridge values from `us-east-1`:

1. `cdk deploy` writes the WAF ARN into an SSM Parameter in `us-east-1`.
2. A CDK-managed custom resource in the frontend stack's region reads that SSM parameter at deploy time.
3. The WAF ARN is resolved and attached to the CloudFront distribution.

Entirely transparent — pass `waf.web_acl_arn` in `app.py` like any other stack property. The SSM parameters are CloudFormation-managed and cleaned up on `cdk destroy`.

The backend exposes `api_url` similarly; the frontend stack injects it into `config.json` via `BucketDeployment`, and the browser fetches `/config.json` at runtime so the API URL is never hardcoded.

Static assets live in `frontend/` — currently just an `index.html` that fetches `config.json` and calls the API. Replace with a built SPA bundle (e.g. Vite/Next.js `dist/`) and `BucketDeployment` picks it up automatically.

#### S3 bucket

The bucket is fully private — no public access of any kind. CloudFront reaches it exclusively via [Origin Access Control (OAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html), the current AWS-recommended successor to OAI. The bucket is encrypted with SSE-KMS (customer-managed key with 90-day rotation), has SSL enforced, server access logging enabled to a dedicated log bucket, versioning disabled (git is the source of truth), and `auto_delete_objects=True` so `cdk destroy` empties and deletes it cleanly.

The access log bucket itself uses SSE-S3 rather than SSE-KMS — neither the S3 log delivery service nor CloudFront standard logging support writing to KMS-encrypted target buckets. The bucket is organized by prefix: `cloudfront/` for CloudFront standard logs, `s3-access-logs/` for S3 server access logs, and `athena-results/` for Athena query output. Glue catalog tables point at the log prefixes so Athena can query them directly with SQL. Athena's `PutObject` calls override the bucket-level SSE-S3 default on a per-object basis to write query results under `athena-results/` with SSE-KMS using the frontend CMK; the bucket-default constraint only applies to objects S3 chooses the encryption for, not to objects whose caller specifies it.

A **7-day expiration lifecycle rule** is applied uniformly to every prefix in the access log bucket — appropriate for a sample app where the value of an individual log entry decays quickly. The duration is intentionally short to keep storage cost bounded; tune it for your workload by editing the `lifecycle_rules` block in [hello_world_frontend_stack.py](hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py). Common alternatives: extend the expiration to 30/90/365 days, or replace the flat expiration with a tiered transition — Standard → S3 Standard-IA at 30 days → Glacier Instant Retrieval at 90 days → Glacier Deep Archive at 180 days → expire at 7 years. Per-prefix rules are also supported if logs and Athena results need different retention.

#### CloudTrail object-level data events

A dedicated [CloudTrail Trail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) records every object-level S3 API call (`GetObject`, `PutObject`, `DeleteObject`, etc.) against the frontend bucket and the access-log bucket. This is distinct from CloudTrail management events (which the AWS account already records by default) and from S3 server access logs (which only cover successful reads/writes through the S3 interface, not authorization failures or `DeleteObject` calls).

The trail writes to a separate dedicated bucket (`CloudTrailLogsBucket`) so the audit destination isn't itself among the audited resources — placing trail logs inside one of the buckets being audited would create a feedback loop where every audit write generates another audit event. The trail is also wired to a CloudWatch Log Group and is KMS-encrypted with the frontend stack's customer-managed key. File integrity validation is enabled, so CloudTrail publishes signed digest files that let you detect after-the-fact tampering with log entries.

*Cost/value note — this is the most expensive item in the recent hardening pass.* Honest read: the audited buckets in *this* sample contain a static SPA (`index.html`) and access-log files. Neither is sensitive customer data. The realistic security gain over what S3 server access logs already provide is modest. The reason the Trail is wired in anyway is **pedagogical**: getting object-level CloudTrail right is non-trivial — separate destination bucket to avoid feedback loops, KMS encryption, CloudWatch Logs delivery, file integrity validation, the cdk-nag suppressions on the auto-generated LogsRole — and the pattern transfers cleanly to forks where the audited buckets *do* hold sensitive data. The dollar cost at zero/sample traffic is also near zero (CloudTrail data events are billed per call: $0.10 per 100,000 events). Watch the *CloudTrail data event* line item in Cost Explorer if you fork into a high-traffic context — the price scales linearly with S3 API call volume and a busy production fork can easily generate $50–$200/month. If you fork this for a workload where the audited buckets aren't sensitive, removing the Trail is a clean one-call deletion (the helper [`_create_s3_audit_trail`](hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py)).

#### CloudFront distribution

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Viewer protocol | Redirect HTTP → HTTPS | Prevents plaintext traffic |
| Minimum TLS | TLS 1.2 (2021 policy) | Drops obsolete TLS 1.0/1.1 |
| Cache policy | `CACHING_OPTIMIZED` | S3 static assets — aggressive caching is correct |
| Response headers | `SECURITY_HEADERS` managed policy | Adds HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc. |
| Default root object | `index.html` | Serves the app at `/` |
| Error responses | 403/404 → `index.html` (200) | Supports SPA client-side routing |
| Cache invalidation | `/*` on frontend asset changes | New assets served immediately; backend-only deploys leave the CloudFront cache untouched (see Design decisions) |
| Access logging | S3 bucket with `cloudfront/` prefix | Every viewer request logged for audit and debugging |

#### WAF rules

The WebACL sits in front of CloudFront and inspects every request before it reaches S3. Five rules are active, evaluated in priority order:

| Priority | Rule | What it blocks |
|----------|------|---------------|
| 0 | `AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList` | Known malicious IPs — botnets, scanners, TOR exits |
| 1 | `AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet` | OWASP Top 10 web exploits |
| 2 | `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` | Requests containing SQLi, XSS, and exploit payloads |
| 3 | `AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList` | Requests from VPNs, Tor exits, hosting providers, and other anonymizing services |
| 4 | `RateLimitPerIP` (custom) | Blocks any single client exceeding 200 requests per 5 minutes, keyed on `X-Forwarded-For` |

The rate-limit rule uses `aggregate_key_type="FORWARDED_IP"` with `header_name="X-Forwarded-For"` and `fallback_behavior="MATCH"`. All traffic enters through CloudFront, so the source IP at WAF is CloudFront's edge — without `FORWARDED_IP`, every viewer would be aggregated under whichever edge they happened to land on. `MATCH` makes a missing or malformed XFF trip the rule rather than skip it, so a determined caller can't bypass by stripping the header.

All rules are AWS WAF "free-tier" — no per-rule-group entity activation fee. Total fixed cost is $5/month (WebACL) + $1/month per rule = $10/month, plus $0.60 per million inspected requests. The four paid-tier managed rule groups (Bot Control, ATP, ACFP, AntiDDoSRuleSet) layer $10–20/month entity fees on top — see the AntiDDoS write-up in [Design decisions](#design-decisions-and-known-limitations).

Every rule emits CloudWatch metrics and sampled requests. WAF access logs go to a CloudWatch log group named `aws-waf-logs-{stack_name}` (the `aws-waf-logs-` prefix is an AWS requirement), KMS-encrypted with the customer-managed key, 1-week retention. The WebACL lives in `HelloWorldWafStack`, always pinned to `us-east-1` per AWS's CloudFront constraint — the cross-region reference pattern above wires the ARN to CloudFront automatically.

#### Observability

Every layer of the stack emits structured logs and/or traces:

| Layer | Log destination | Format | X-Ray |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Lambda** | CloudWatch Logs (JSON) | Powertools Logger — `xray_trace_id`, `function_name`, `request_id`, `level`, `message`, `timestamp`, `service`, plus custom keys | `tracing=Tracing.ACTIVE` |
| **API Gateway (access)** | CloudWatch Logs (JSON) | 16 fields via typed `AccessLogField` references — `requestId`, `accountId`, `apiId`, `stage`, `resourcePath`, `httpMethod`, `protocol`, `status`, `responseType`, `errorMessage`, `requestTime`, `ip`, `caller`, `user`, `responseLength`, `xrayTraceId` | `tracing_enabled=True` |
| **API Gateway (execution)** | CloudWatch Logs | AWS-managed format — request/response payloads, integration latency, errors | Same as above |
| **CloudFront** | S3 (`cloudfront/` prefix) | AWS fixed 33-field tab-delimited format — client IP, URI, status, edge location, etc. | N/A (traces propagate from API Gateway → Lambda) |
| **S3** | S3 (`s3-access-logs/` prefix) | AWS fixed 26-field space-delimited format — requester, operation, key, status, bytes | N/A |
| **WAF** | CloudWatch Logs (`aws-waf-logs-*`) | AWS JSON — action, rule matched, request headers, country, URI | N/A |
| **Browser (RUM)** | CloudWatch RUM + CloudWatch Logs | AWS JSON — page loads, JS errors, Core Web Vitals, fetch timings, user interactions, session/user IDs | Client-side segment joins the backend trace via `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` |

X-Ray traces flow end-to-end: the browser RUM client emits a client-side segment and attaches an `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` header to outbound fetches, API Gateway continues that trace, Lambda adds subsegments (via Powertools Tracer `@tracer.capture_method`), and the `xrayTraceId` is included in API Gateway access logs for correlation. S3 and CloudFront access logs use AWS-fixed formats that are not customizable.

**CloudWatch RUM.** The frontend stack provisions an `AWS::RUM::AppMonitor` with `EnableXRay=true`. The app monitor ID, identity pool ID, and region are injected into `frontend/config.json` at deploy time; the HTML loads the RUM snippet from `<head>`, initializes `cwr` with `enableXRay: true`, and the single X-Ray trace shows browser → CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda in one timeline. API Gateway CORS is configured to allow the `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` request header so the browser's trace ID propagates through the preflight.

The browser loads four plugins: `errors` (uncaught JS exceptions and unhandled promise rejections via `window.onerror`), `performance` (page load timings, Core Web Vitals), `http` (`fetch`/`XHR` latency and status), and `interaction` (user click events). The `errors` telemetry only catches *uncaught* exceptions — caught errors are invisible to RUM unless explicitly recorded, so the API-call handler in [frontend/index.html](frontend/index.html) calls `window.cwr("recordError", err)` from its `catch` block to surface API failures that the page swallows into an inline message.

The plugin set is *not* the same list in both places. The CloudFormation schema for `AWS::RUM::AppMonitor.AppMonitorConfiguration.Telemetries` accepts only `["errors", "performance", "http"]` and rejects `"interaction"` as an invalid enum value, even though `interaction` is a real, supported plugin. That server-side list is documentation for the AWS-generated snippet, not the live loader; the actual plugin set is controlled by the client-side `telemetries` array in `frontend/index.html`. So the AppMonitor lists three telemetries and the client lists four. Keep them divergent on purpose.

The `http` telemetry is written as a `[name, config]` tuple — `["http", { addXRayTraceIdHeader: true }]` — rather than the bare-string form. `enableXRay: true` defaults `addXRayTraceIdHeader` to true today, but stating it explicitly guards against future client-version regressions of that default and matches the AWS reference snippet pattern.

**Custom events.** The AppMonitor sets `CustomEvents.Status: ENABLED` so the frontend can call `cwr('recordEvent', type, details)` for domain telemetry beyond what the standard plugins capture. Without that flag, custom event uploads are silently dropped at the data plane. No event types are recorded today; the wiring is in place for when the application gains business-meaningful interactions.

**Session attributes.** Deploy-time metadata is attached to every RUM event in the session via `sessionAttributes`. The frontend stack injects `applicationName: <stack-name>` into `frontend/config.json`, and the client snippet reads it into the `cwr` config. Sourcing attributes from the deployed config (rather than hardcoding in the HTML) lets multiple deploys feed the same dashboard while remaining filterable. Attribute limits: max 10 per event, key ≤128 chars (alphanumeric, `:`, `_`, no `aws:` prefix, no reserved keys like `browserName`/`pageTitle`/`version`), value ≤256 chars (string/number/boolean).

**Extended metrics.** By default, RUM publishes scalar CloudWatch metrics (`JsErrorCount`, `Http4xxCount`, `PageViewCount`, `PerformanceNavigationDuration`, etc.) with only the `application_name` dimension — useful for top-line counts but blind to *which* browser, device, country, or page is producing them. Extended metrics add user-agent / geo / page dimensions to those scalars so dashboards can slice the same metric multiple ways. The frontend stack registers a CloudWatch destination on the AppMonitor and creates seven extended metric definitions covering JS errors (by browser / device / country), HTTP errors (by browser), and per-page navigation timing and view counts.

There is no native CloudFormation resource for RUM metric destinations or definitions — both are managed via the RUM API only — so the stack uses two `AwsCustomResource` constructs to call `PutRumMetricsDestination` and `BatchCreateRumMetricDefinitions` at deploy time. Several operational notes worth knowing if you change this code:

- **Each definition needs an `EventPattern`.** The AWS docs imply you can register a vended metric (`JsErrorCount`, `Http4xxCount`, etc.) with just `Name` and `DimensionKeys` and let RUM supply the `ValueKey` internally. This isn't true: the API requires an `EventPattern` that filters to the right RUM event type AND existence-checks every dimension key. Without one, the API returns `200 OK` with an `Errors[]` body — which `AwsCustomResource` treats as success — so the definitions silently never get created. The patterns in [hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py](hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py) match `event_type` (`com.amazon.rum.js_error_event`, `com.amazon.rum.http_event`, `com.amazon.rum.page_view_event`) plus `{"exists":true}` checks on each dimension key.
- **Http5xxCount has a vended-metric quirk.** Adding an explicit numeric range filter on `event_details.response.status` works for `Http4xxCount` but is rejected for `Http5xxCount` ("Value … for metric field event detail is not valid"). RUM applies the 5xx filter internally for that metric, so the EventPattern must omit the status range; for Http4xx the range is required. The two patterns are deliberately not symmetric.
- **`PerformanceNavigationDuration` is left out.** With our dimension shape RUM rejected it as "Value `event_details.duration` for metric field value key is not valid". A working configuration is possible but requires a different vended-metric or custom-metric form than the others; not worth the complexity for the reference architecture.
- **`on_create` and `on_update` reference the same call.** `AwsCustomResource` no-ops on CloudFormation UPDATE events when `on_update` is omitted. Without it, edits to the metric-definitions list never propagate to AWS — the deploy succeeds, the AppMonitor is unchanged, no error is reported.
- **Updates accumulate.** `BatchCreateRumMetricDefinitions` is not idempotent: re-running it with the same definitions creates duplicates rather than reconciling. If you change the metric list and want a clean replacement (rather than the old set plus the new set side-by-side), destroy and redeploy the frontend stack so the AppMonitor cascade-deletes its configuration before the new set is registered.
- **No alarms are wired.** Recording the metrics with dimensions is enough to enable ad-hoc CloudWatch metric queries and dashboard widgets sliced by the new dimensions; binding specific thresholds to alarms is a separate decision left to the operator.

There are also two CDK ordering concerns worth understanding:

- **IAM propagation.** The `RumMetricsDestination` policy bundles all three `rum:*` actions (`PutRumMetricsDestination`, `DeleteRumMetricsDestination`, `BatchCreateRumMetricDefinitions`) on the *first* AwsCustomResource so they ride a single policy attachment. By the time `RumExtendedMetrics` fires, the policy has been on the singleton role through one full `PutRumMetricsDestination` round-trip — enough lead time for IAM to propagate. Splitting the actions across each construct's own policy lost the race consistently with `AccessDenied`.
- **`BucketDeployment` depends on `RumExtendedMetrics`.** This is intentional: if `RumExtendedMetrics` fails, `BucketDeployment` never runs, which avoids the [known CDK bug](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/15891) where the BucketDeployment provider's CloudFront invalidation can't complete during a rollback that's deleting the same distribution. Without this dependency, a metrics-side failure produces an unrecoverable `ROLLBACK_FAILED` stack with orphaned CloudFront, S3, and OAC resources that have to be cleaned up manually.

**Why Cognito.** Browsers are anonymous — they have no prior identity and nowhere to safely store long-lived AWS credentials — but the RUM data plane still needs authenticated SigV4 calls to `rum:PutRumEvents`. A Cognito Identity Pool with `AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities=true` is the AWS-standard bridge: it issues short-lived STS credentials to every anonymous browser session, which the RUM client then uses to sign telemetry uploads. This is what makes client-side telemetry possible without shipping an access key to the browser. The trust chain is:

1. **Browser fetches `/config.json`** — gets the identity pool ID, app monitor ID, and region (all non-sensitive public identifiers, safe to embed in static assets).
2. **Browser calls Cognito `GetId` + `GetCredentialsForIdentity`** — the identity pool returns a temporary, unauthenticated identity ID and short-lived STS credentials.
3. **STS assumes `RumUnauthenticatedRole` via `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`** — the role's trust policy requires `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:aud` to match this pool ID and `amr = "unauthenticated"`, so credentials from any other pool or flow are rejected.
4. **RUM client calls `rum:PutRumEvents`** — that is the role's *only* permission, and it's scoped to the one monitor ARN `arn:aws:rum:{region}:{account}:appmonitor/{stack-name}-rum`. A compromised browser session cannot escalate to any other RUM monitor, any other AWS service, or even the same monitor in a different account.

In short: the pool exists because the browser has no identity of its own, and the role exists to make sure anonymous browser credentials can do exactly one thing and nothing else. `AwsSolutions-COG7` (which flags unauthenticated identities) is suppressed on the pool with this rationale — it is the correct model for anonymous telemetry, not a security gap.

#### Access log analytics (Athena + Glue)

CloudFront and S3 access logs are stored in S3, not CloudWatch, so they cannot be queried with CloudWatch Logs Insights. Instead, the frontend stack provisions a Glue Data Catalog and Athena workgroup for SQL-based analytics.

**Glue catalog structure:**

| Table | Source prefix | Format | SerDe |
|-------|--------------|--------|-------|
| `cloudfront_logs` | `cloudfront/` | 33-field tab-delimited (2 header lines) | `LazySimpleSerDe` |
| `s3_access_logs` | `s3-access-logs/` | 26-field with quoted strings | `RegexSerDe` |

**Access log bucket layout:**

```
s3://<access-log-bucket>/
├── cloudfront/       ← CloudFront standard access logs
├── s3-access-logs/   ← S3 server access logs
└── athena-results/   ← Athena query results (SSE-KMS encrypted with the frontend CMK)
```

**Athena named queries (pre-built, ready to run):**

| Query | What it shows |
|-------|--------------|
| CloudFront - Top Requested URIs | Most frequently requested URIs with error counts |
| CloudFront - Error Responses | Recent 4xx/5xx responses with client and edge details |
| CloudFront - Top Client IPs | Highest-traffic client IPs with error counts |
| CloudFront - Bandwidth by Edge Location | Total bytes transferred per edge location |
| CloudFront - Cache Hit Ratio | Request counts and percentages by edge result type |
| S3 - Top Operations | Most common S3 operations with error counts |
| S3 - Error Requests | Recent failed S3 requests with error details |
| S3 - Top Requesters | Highest-traffic S3 requesters with error counts |
| S3 - Slow Requests | Highest-latency requests by `total_time` |
| S3 - Access Denied (403) | Recent 403 AccessDenied responses for IAM/policy debugging |
| S3 - Object Read Audit | Who read which object (GET.OBJECT) with status and bytes |

To run queries, open the Athena console, select the workgroup from the stack outputs, and choose a saved query. Results are stored in the access log bucket under `athena-results/`.

**Scaling note.** Logs land flat under their prefix and queries scan the full dataset. At this app's scale that's free in practice, but if traffic grows enough that Athena scans start costing real money, the standard next step is partitioning by `year=/month=/day=/hour=/` — ideally with Glue partition projection so no `MSCK REPAIR` is needed — and converting to Snappy Parquet for columnar pruning. See the AWS Big Data blog [*Analyze your Amazon CloudFront access logs at scale*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/analyze-your-amazon-cloudfront-access-logs-at-scale/) for a full Lambda + CTAS pipeline. Conversion is fully retroactive: existing gzip logs can be backfilled with a one-shot Athena CTAS whenever the cost justifies the added complexity.

**Query tuning reference.** The named queries above already follow the applicable guidance from [*Top 10 performance tuning tips for Amazon Athena*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-10-performance-tuning-tips-for-amazon-athena/) — every `ORDER BY` is paired with a `LIMIT`, no `SELECT *`, minimal `GROUP BY` columns, no joins, no `COUNT(DISTINCT)`. The remaining tips in that post (partitioning, bucketing, compression, file sizing, columnar formats) are all storage-side and are covered by the scaling note above.

#### Resource cleanup

Every resource in `HelloWorldWafStack` and `HelloWorldFrontendStack` has `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY`, including all CloudWatch log groups. `cdk destroy --all` leaves nothing behind in any region.

Note: CDK creates an internal singleton Lambda to empty the S3 bucket before deletion (`Custom::S3AutoDeleteObjects`). Its log group is explicitly declared in the stack so CloudFormation owns it and deletes it on destroy — following the same principle as the API Gateway execution log group in the backend stack.

### Monitoring

The stack includes a [cdk-monitoring-constructs](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-monitoring-constructs) MonitoringFacade that creates a CloudWatch dashboard with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB metrics out of the box.

## Deploy the application

First-time deploy:

```bash
make install                                              # both venvs + pre-commit hooks
finch vm start && export CDK_DOCKER=finch                 # or: ensure Docker is running
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/us-east-1             # always required (WAF lives here)
cdk deploy --all
```

CDK uses the container runtime pointed to by `CDK_DOCKER` and falls back to Docker when unset ([context](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/23680#issuecomment-1741643237)). The first synth pulls the AWS Lambda Python build image (distributed via the SAM project — that's the "SAM build image" label in logs) and builds the deployment package from `lambda/requirements.txt`.

### Recommended order for ongoing deploys

Each step catches a different class of failure cheaply, before AWS sees anything:

```bash
make cdk-synth                                            # 1. synth + cdk-nag (4-pack: AwsSolutions, NIST 800-53 R5, HIPAA, PCI DSS 3.2.1)
make test-cdk                                             # 2. CDK assertion tests (resource counts, properties, suppression coverage)
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/us-east-1             # 3. one-time per account+region; idempotent if already done
cdk deploy --all --require-approval never                 # 4. --require-approval never since cdk-nag already gated IAM diffs in step 1
                                                          # 5. CfnOutputs (CloudFrontDomainName, HelloWorldApiOutput, RumAppMonitorId, CloudWatchDashboardUrl) print at the end
```

Skip a step only when you don't need that gate: skip 1 if just synthesized in another shell, skip 2 if iterating on a resource the assertion tests don't cover, skip 3 once the region is bootstrapped. Steps 4 and 5 are not optional.

After deployment, each stack exposes these CfnOutputs:

**`HelloWorldWaf-{region}`:**
- `WebAclArn` — WAF WebACL ARN (also used internally by the frontend stack)
- `WebAclId` — WAF WebACL logical ID
- `WafLogGroupName` — CloudWatch log group name for WAF access logs

**`HelloWorld-{region}`:**
- `HelloWorldApiOutput` — API Gateway endpoint URL (`https://.../Prod/hello`)
- `HelloWorldFunctionOutput` — Lambda function ARN
- `HelloWorldFunctionIamRoleOutput` — Lambda IAM role ARN
- `IdempotencyTableName` — DynamoDB table name
- `GreetingParameterName` — SSM parameter path
- `AppConfigAppName` — AppConfig application name
- `CloudWatchDashboardUrl` — Direct link to the CloudWatch monitoring dashboard

**`HelloWorldFrontend-{region}`:**
- `CloudFrontDomainName` — `https://` URL to open in a browser
- `CloudFrontDistributionId` — Distribution ID for manual cache invalidations
- `FrontendBucketName` — S3 bucket name for direct asset inspection
- `GlueDatabaseName` — Glue catalog database for access log analytics
- `AthenaWorkGroupName` — Athena workgroup for querying access logs

### Deploying to a different region

Each target region must be bootstrapped before its first deploy. Bootstrap is a one-time step per region per account.

```bash
# Bootstrap the target region (in addition to us-east-1 which is always needed)
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/ap-southeast-1

# Deploy all stacks — WAF stays in us-east-1, backend and frontend go to ap-southeast-1
cdk deploy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1
```

### Destroying a deployment

```bash
# Destroy the default us-east-1 deployment
cdk destroy --all

# Destroy a specific regional deployment (does not affect other regions)
cdk destroy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1
```

### Cleanup

```bash
cdk destroy
```

Every resource (including all log groups) is `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` — a single `cdk destroy` leaves no dangling resources or ongoing AWS costs.

## Working in the codebase

### Add a resource to your application

Define new constructs in the appropriate file under `hello_world/`:

- **Backend domain resources** (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SSM, AppConfig — anything the Lambda talks to) go in `hello_world_app.py` inside the `HelloWorldApp` construct.
- **Frontend resources** (S3, CloudFront) go in `hello_world_frontend_stack.py`.
- **WAF rules** go in `hello_world_waf_stack.py`.
- `hello_world_stack.py` stays lean — only add things that are genuinely stack-wide (CfnOutput, Aspect, stack-level nag suppression).

Browse [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/) for high-level constructs. For resources without one, drop down to [CloudFormation resource types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) via `CfnResource`.

### Useful CDK commands

* `cdk ls`                         list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`                      emit the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy --all`               deploy all stacks to us-east-1 (default)
* `cdk deploy --all -c region=X`   deploy all stacks to region X
* `cdk diff`                       compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk destroy --all`              destroy all stacks in the default region

### Synthesize and validate locally

Synthesize your application to verify the CloudFormation template (requires a container runtime — Finch or Docker — to be running):

```bash
# If using Finch:
export CDK_DOCKER=finch
cdk synth

# If using Docker: just run `cdk synth` — CDK auto-detects Docker
cdk synth
```

For local *invocation* of the Lambda handler, use the pytest-driven debug flow described in [Debugging the Lambda function](#debugging-the-lambda-function) — `sam local invoke` is intentionally not used by this project (the unpinned `debugpy` it injects conflicts with the project's `--require-hashes` install mode for `lambda/requirements.txt`).

### Debugging the Lambda function

This project does **not** use `sam local invoke`. SAM injects an unpinned `debugpy` that conflicts with the project's `--require-hashes` install mode (`lambda/requirements.txt` is pinned by hash via `uv export`); dropping hash-mode would weaken supply-chain integrity across every CI install. Debug through pytest instead.

**The pytest-as-debugger pattern.** Open a test file under [tests/unit/](tests/unit/) that exercises the path you want to inspect, set a breakpoint anywhere in [lambda/app.py](lambda/app.py), press F5 → *Pytest: Current File*. The handler runs in-process with all of Powertools' real machinery (resolver routing, middleware, idempotency, route handlers). Breakpoints, step-through, watch expressions, exception inspection all work. The fixtures in [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) build realistic API Gateway events, so the resolver sees the same shape it does in production. Covers roughly 90% of what you'd debug: handler logic, parsers, validators, idempotency keys, response shapes, exception paths, feature-flag evaluation.

**What pytest debug cannot reproduce** (deployed-only):

- **Lambda runtime behavior** — cold-start timing, init-phase code, 250 MB unzipped package limit, 512 MB `/tmp` cap, configured memory ceiling.
- **IAM** — your local AWS credentials are used, not the Lambda execution role. Permission denials in prod won't surface locally.
- **Real AWS service calls** — most unit tests mock boto3. Service-side behavior (DynamoDB throttling, SSM resolution latency, AppConfig deploy cadence) is invisible.
- **Network and runtime context** — VPC routing, layers, container reuse, deployed env vars.

**For the remaining 10%, debug on the deployed function** via the observability stack:

- **Powertools `Logger`** — structured JSON to CloudWatch with `correlation_id` from the API Gateway request ID. Filter Logs Insights by that ID to follow one request end-to-end.
- **X-Ray traces** (auto-enabled via Powertools `Tracer`) — full call graph including SDK calls to DynamoDB, SSM, AppConfig with per-segment timing. Spots cold-start init time, downstream latency, IAM denials (red segments).
- **CloudWatch RUM** — correlates frontend requests to backend X-Ray traces via the `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` CORS header. Pivot from a slow user session to the matching backend trace.
- **CloudWatch Metrics** — custom Powertools metrics + the `MonitoringFacade` dashboard. Throttles, errors, concurrency at the aggregate level.

Local debug for logic, deployed observability for runtime behavior — the standard serverless-Python workflow once Powertools' structured-logging + X-Ray story is in place.

### Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

The AWS CLI `logs tail` command streams a CloudWatch log group directly — no SAM CLI dependency. Get the function's log group from the backend stack outputs (or look it up in the AWS Console under the Lambda's *Monitor* tab):

```bash
# Tail the live stream (Ctrl+C to stop)
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/HelloWorld-us-east-1-AppHelloWorldFunction... --follow

# Filter for errors only
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/HelloWorld-us-east-1-AppHelloWorldFunction... --follow \
    --filter-pattern '{ $.level = "ERROR" }'

# Tail with a JMESPath filter, picking out one structured field per line
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/HelloWorld-us-east-1-AppHelloWorldFunction... --follow \
    --format short \
    --filter-pattern '{ $.correlation_id = "abc-123" }'
```

The Lambda's `logging_format=JSON` config makes every line valid JSON, which `--filter-pattern` queries against directly using [CloudWatch metric-filter syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html). Pair with [Powertools' `correlation_id` injection](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/core/logger/#setting-a-correlation-id) to follow a single request end-to-end across all the structured log entries it produced.

For richer ad-hoc queries (joins across log groups, percentile aggregations, time-series visualizations), use [CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html) in the AWS Console — the WAF stack already pre-creates three saved queries (see [WAF rules](#waf-rules)) as a model for how to wire those into CDK.

### Commit message convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format:

```
type: short description
```

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks that don't affect functionality (lock files, Makefile, LICENSE) |
| `ci` | Changes to CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions, pre-commit) |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `build` | Changes to the build system or dependencies |

The committed history is the input to **[git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff)** (config in [`cliff.toml`](cliff.toml)), which generates [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) by mapping these types into [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) groups (Added / Fixed / Documentation / CI/CD / Refactored / Tests / Removed / Maintenance / etc.). Regenerate after each release with `git cliff -o CHANGELOG.md`; for an unreleased section against `HEAD` prepend it with `git cliff --unreleased --prepend CHANGELOG.md`. Dependabot bumps (`build(deps):` / `chore(deps):` / bare `Bump X from Y to Z`) and `Merge pull request` commits are filtered out by `cliff.toml` so the changelog reflects feature / fix / docs / CI history rather than dependency churn.

Forks that want to *enforce* the convention at author time (rather than rely on the reviewer + pre-commit gates) can adopt **[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen)** as an interactive authoring helper — it prompts for type/scope/description and refuses to create commits that don't conform. Intentionally not wired into this project because the convention is short enough to author by hand and the existing pre-commit hooks catch the common drift sources; meaningful in larger teams where conformance otherwise erodes.

### Cutting a release

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and are driven from the conventional-commit history. The end-to-end recipe:

```bash
# 1. Ask git-cliff what version to bump to based on commits since the last tag
git cliff --bumped-version

# 2. Bump pyproject.toml to that version, regenerate the lockfiles
sed -i '' 's/^version = ".*"/version = "X.Y.Z"/' pyproject.toml
make lock

# 3. Regenerate the changelog (treats unreleased commits as if tagged X.Y.Z)
git cliff --tag vX.Y.Z -o CHANGELOG.md

# 4. Commit everything in one chore commit
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"

# 5. Tag with annotated release notes — the body shows up on the Releases page
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z — short title

Longer release notes here..."

# 6. Push the commit and the tag
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 7. Publish the GitHub Release (pulls notes from the annotated tag)
gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-from-tag --latest --verify-tag
```

A few non-obvious details:

- **`git cliff --bumped-version`** reads conventional-commit types since the last tag and follows SemVer: `feat:` triggers a minor bump, `fix:` a patch, `docs`/`chore`/`ci` etc. stay at patch. Breaking changes (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) trigger a major bump. v1.0.1 was chosen this way — only `docs:` commits since v1.0.0, so `--bumped-version` returned `v1.0.1`.
- **`make lock`** regenerates `uv.lock` and `lambda/requirements.txt` so the lockfile records the new project version. The only diff in `uv.lock` is the one-line `version =` field for this project; transitive pins do not move.
- **`git cliff --tag vX.Y.Z -o CHANGELOG.md`** regenerates the *entire* `CHANGELOG.md` rather than prepending — this keeps the footer URL list (`[X.Y.Z]: .../compare/..`) consistent across releases. The cost is rewriting unchanged previous sections; in practice that's a no-op since the content is deterministic.
- **`--notes-from-tag`** on `gh release create` pulls the annotated tag body into the GitHub Release object, so the same release notes are available via `git show vX.Y.Z`, the GitHub web UI, and the Releases API without duplicating them.
- **`--verify-tag`** rejects the call if the tag doesn't exist on origin, catching the "forgot to `git push origin vX.Y.Z`" case before it creates an orphan Release.

### Documentation

The docs site is built by [Zensical](https://zensical.org/) (MkDocs-Material's successor, same maintainer) with the [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) Python handler. It covers two audiences:

- **Code reference (for developers)** — autodoc pages for `lambda/app.py`, `hello_world/hello_world_stack.py`, `hello_world/hello_world_app.py`, `hello_world/hello_world_waf_stack.py`, `hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py`, and `hello_world/nag_utils.py`. Generated from Google-style docstrings via `::: module.path` directives.
- **HTTP API reference (for callers)** — a [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar) page at `/api.html` rendering `/openapi.json`. Both files are pre-built by `scripts/generate_openapi.py` (imports the Lambda resolver, serializes its schema) and copied into the site verbatim by Zensical. `make docs` regenerates the spec before invoking Zensical, so the API page always matches live code. Scalar's OSS bundle includes a request sandbox — unlike Redoc, where "Try it out" requires Redocly's paid tier.

The Scalar bundle is loaded from jsdelivr with a **pinned version + SRI hash** (not `@latest`). The browser verifies integrity on every load; CDN tampering fails closed. Upgrade is two lines in `docs/api.html` (the file has an `openssl` recipe in its comments). Scalar's code-sample panel defaults to **Python + `requests`** via `defaultHttpClient` since callers of this API are overwhelmingly writing Python; other languages stay one click away.

Doc builds are best run in CI/CD or manually before publishing, not on every commit.

```bash
make docs        # build (runs: python scripts/generate_openapi.py && zensical build)
make docs-open   # build + open site/index.html
make docs-serve  # dev server with hot reload
```

## Quality and security

### Tests

Tests live in `tests/`. Run via `make test` (unit, in `.venv-lambda`), `make test-cdk` (CDK assertions, in `.venv`), or `make test-integration` (live deployment).

#### Unit test architecture

Unit tests mock all external AWS dependencies so they run locally without credentials or a deployed stack:

- **Shared fixtures** in `tests/conftest.py` (API Gateway event, Lambda context, app module reference). The autouse mock for SSM Parameters and Feature Flags lives in `tests/unit/conftest.py` so it only applies to unit tests.
- **Env vars centralized** in `pyproject.toml` via pytest-env — Powertools config, mock resource names, and `POWERTOOLS_IDEMPOTENCY_DISABLED=true` (the Powertools-recommended way to skip DynamoDB calls during tests; not set in production).
- **External calls mocked** via `pytest-mock`'s `mocker.patch.object()` against `get_parameter` and `feature_flags.evaluate`. The Lambda context is a `MagicMock` with realistic attributes.
- **Import path isolation** — `tests/conftest.py` puts `lambda/` on `sys.path` before the root so `import app` resolves to the Lambda handler (`lambda/app.py`), not the CDK entry point (`app.py`).

```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit -v        # or: make test
```

#### CDK stack assertion tests

`tests/cdk/test_stacks.py` synthesizes each stack in-process with `aws_cdk.assertions.Template` and asserts security properties (KMS encryption on DynamoDB, PITR, CloudFront TLS policy, WAF attached, etc.). Any unsuppressed cdk-nag finding fails synth — these tests double as a CI gate for infrastructure misconfigurations. Asset bundling (Docker) is skipped via the `aws:cdk:bundling-stacks` context key, so the tests run without Docker.

`TestLogicalIdStability` enforces the CDK best practice ["don't change logical IDs of stateful resources"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html): logical IDs of stateful resources (DynamoDB, KMS keys, S3 buckets, CloudFront, SSM, AppConfig, WAF WebACL, log groups) are frozen in a committed list. A refactor that renames a stateful construct would change its logical ID, which means resource replacement = data loss. The test catches that drift at PR time. If you genuinely need to change one, update the expected value in the same commit so intent is reviewable.

```bash
python -m pytest tests/cdk -v --override-ini="addopts="    # or: make test-cdk
```

#### Integration tests

Two suites verify the live deployment:

- **API Gateway** (`tests/integration/test_api_gateway.py`) — calls the endpoint, asserts response body, content type, and < 10s response time (covers cold starts with SSM + AppConfig init).
- **CloudFront / S3** (`tests/integration/test_frontend.py`) — fetches the distribution URL from stack outputs, asserts index page served, `config.json` contains the injected API URL, HTTPS enforced, security headers present, unknown paths fall back to `index.html` (SPA routing).

Stack names default to `HelloWorld-us-east-1` / `HelloWorldFrontend-us-east-1` (from `pyproject.toml`'s pytest-env block). Override for other regions:

```bash
AWS_BACKEND_STACK_NAME=HelloWorld-ap-southeast-1 \
AWS_FRONTEND_STACK_NAME=HelloWorldFrontend-ap-southeast-1 \
pytest tests/integration/
# Or: make test-integration
```

Either suite auto-skips if its stack isn't deployed — `pytest` stays green without a live deployment.

#### Pytest behavior

All driven by `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`:

| Behavior | Config |
|---|---|
| **Timeout** | `timeout = 30` (per-test); override with `@pytest.mark.timeout(60)` |
| **Randomization** | pytest-randomly auto-activates and shuffles every run; seed printed at top — replay via `--randomly-seed=12345`, disable via `-p no:randomly` |
| **Coverage** | `--cov=lambda --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=100 --no-cov-on-fail`; HTML report at `htmlcov/index.html` |
| **Parallel** | `-n auto` via pytest-xdist; disable for debugging with `-n0` |
| **HTML report** | `--html=report.html --self-contained-html` generated on every run |

### Linting and static analysis

All tools are configured in `pyproject.toml` (except bandit, which uses `.bandit` for YAML-config compatibility with its pre-commit hook). Run individually or together:

```bash
ruff check .                            # lint
ruff format .                           # format            (or: make format)
mypy lambda/ hello_world/               # type check        (or: make typecheck)
pylint lambda/ hello_world/             # design + complexity
bandit -r lambda/ hello_world/          # security scan
pip-audit                               # dep vulnerabilities  (bandit + pip-audit: make security)
radon cc lambda/ -a                     # cyclomatic complexity
xenon lambda/ -b B -m A -a A            # complexity gates

pre-commit run --all-files              # run everything (or: make lint)
```

#### Bandit configuration (`.bandit`)

Bandit is a security-focused static analyzer that scans Python source code for common vulnerabilities. Its configuration lives in `.bandit` rather than `pyproject.toml` because the pre-commit bandit hook reads YAML config files by convention.

The `.bandit` file specifies which directories to exclude from scanning:

| Directory | Reason excluded |
|---|---|
| `tests/` | Test code uses `assert`, hardcoded strings, and other patterns that trigger false positives |
| `cdk.out/` | CDK-generated CloudFormation output — not code you write or can fix |
| `.venv/` | Third-party packages — vulnerabilities here are caught by `pip-audit` instead |

Everything outside these directories — `lambda/` and `hello_world/` — is scanned. That is the code you own and ship.

### Detecting deprecated APIs

Deprecated APIs keep working until the next major release removes them. No single tool catches every kind, so this project uses five approaches targeting different layers:

| # | Approach | Catches | How to run |
|---|----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | **CDK API deprecations** | Deprecated CDK properties/methods (e.g. `FunctionOptions#logRetention` → `logGroup`) | `make cdk-deprecations` (greps `cdk synth` output for `deprecated`) |
| 2 | **`cdk notices`** | AWS-published advisories about the CDK toolchain — CVEs, deprecated CDK versions, breaking changes | `make cdk-notices` |
| 3 | **Python `DeprecationWarning` in tests** | Deprecated stdlib or third-party calls (boto3, Powertools, etc.) hit by tests | Temporarily set `filterwarnings = ["error::DeprecationWarning"]` in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, run `pytest`, revert. Too noisy to leave on permanently |
| 4 | **Ruff `UP` (pyupgrade)** | Deprecated Python syntax — `typing.List` → `list`, `Optional[X]` → `X \| None` | Enabled in `[tool.ruff.lint]` `select`. Runs on every `make lint` and commit |
| 5 | **`pip list --outdated`** | Version drift — packages multiple majors behind are likely calling deprecated APIs | `pip list --outdated` |

`cdk synth` no longer passes `--no-notices`, so notices and CDK deprecation warnings print on every synth in local and CI runs.

### Pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit runs a chain of hooks on every `git commit`. Set up once after cloning with `pre-commit install`. Run manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`.

#### Hook reference

| Hook | Source | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ruff` | local (venv) | Lints and auto-fixes; runs before formatting |
| `ruff-format` | local (venv) | Formats code (equivalent to black) |
| `mypy` | local (venv) | Static type checking on `lambda/` and `hello_world/` (excludes `app.py` and `tests/`); `require_serial: true` to avoid SQLite cache lock contention on CI |
| `bandit` | local (venv) | Security-focused static analysis on `lambda/` and `hello_world/` |
| `pylint` | local (venv) | Design and complexity checks on non-test, non-docs Python files |
| `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `check-yaml`, `check-json` | pre-commit-hooks | File hygiene (newlines, trailing whitespace, YAML/JSON validity) |
| `xenon` | local (venv) | Cyclomatic complexity thresholds on `lambda/` (max absolute B, module A, average A) |
| `pip-audit` | local (venv) | Scans installed deps for known CVEs |

Every tool that's also in `pyproject.toml` runs as a `language: system` hook from the project venv — single source of truth, no version drift between `pre-commit` config and `pyproject.toml` (see commit history `bba3ba0`/`a04d942`).

**Aligning VS Code editor output with CI** (optional). The Microsoft Pylint/Mypy and Astral Ruff extensions default to `importStrategy: "useBundled"`, which runs the binary bundled *inside the extension* rather than the one in `uv.lock`. Bundled versions can drift from the pyproject pins (`ruff==0.15.12`, `mypy==1.20.2`, `pylint==4.0.5`), so a clean editor can hide a CI failure. To use the same binaries everywhere, add this to your **User Settings** (not the committed workspace settings):

```json
"ruff.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment",
"mypy-type-checker.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment",
"pylint.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment"
```

This points each extension at `.venv/bin/`. Not in committed workspace settings because a fresh clone before `uv sync --group lint` would have empty `.venv/bin/` paths and the extensions would either silently fall back to bundled or surface confusing errors. Opt in once the lint group is synced.

### Security

Security follows the AWS [CDK security best practices guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices-security.html) (least-privilege IAM, encryption at rest and in transit, cdk-nag in the synth loop, no hardcoded secrets) and is enforced at three complementary layers:

| Layer | Tool | Scans | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Source code** | bandit | `lambda/` and `hello_world/` for hardcoded secrets, shell injection, unsafe deserialization, etc. | Pre-commit + CI quality job |
| **Dependencies** | pip-audit | Every group in `uv.lock` for known CVEs | Pre-commit + weekly Dependency Audit workflow |
| **Infrastructure** | cdk-nag | CDK stacks against AWS Solutions, Serverless, NIST 800-53 R5, HIPAA, PCI DSS 3.2.1 | `cdk synth` — unsuppressed findings fail synthesis |

### CDK security checks

All three stacks use [cdk-nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag) with five rule packs applied at synth time. Any unsuppressed finding fails `cdk synth` — infrastructure misconfigurations are caught before deployment. Checks run automatically on every `cdk synth` and `cdk deploy`; the pack set is attached by [`apply_compliance_aspects`](hello_world/nag_utils.py), called from each stack's constructor, so adding or removing a pack is a one-line change in one place.

#### Rule packs in use

| Pack | Import | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| `AwsSolutionsChecks` | `from cdk_nag import AwsSolutionsChecks` | AWS general best practices — IAM, encryption, logging, resilience |
| `ServerlessChecks` | `from cdk_nag import ServerlessChecks` | Serverless-specific rules — Lambda DLQ, tracing, memory, throttling |
| `NIST80053R5Checks` | `from cdk_nag import NIST80053R5Checks` | NIST 800-53 Rev 5 controls — the current standard used by many enterprises and federal workloads |
| `HIPAASecurityChecks` | `from cdk_nag import HIPAASecurityChecks` | HIPAA Security Rule — required when handling protected health information (PHI) |
| `PCIDSS321Checks` | `from cdk_nag import PCIDSS321Checks` | PCI DSS 3.2.1 — required when handling payment card data |

Running the HIPAA and PCI packs on top of NIST 800-53 R5 turned out to surface **zero net-new findings** on this stack — every rule that tripped was a same-named counterpart of a rule already raised (and suppressed) by NIST R5 (e.g. `HIPAA.Security-LambdaInsideVPC` duplicates `NIST.800.53.R5-LambdaInsideVPC`). The packs are kept enabled anyway so any future drift that introduces a HIPAA- or PCI-specific control gap is caught at synth time rather than in a later audit.

#### Other available rule packs

cdk-nag ships one additional pack that is not enabled in this project. It can be added by importing and applying it the same way as the packs above:

| Pack | Import | When to use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `NIST80053R4Checks` | `from cdk_nag import NIST80053R4Checks` | NIST 800-53 Rev 4 — superseded by R5; only use if your compliance framework specifically requires R4. Running it alongside R5 duplicates findings on overlapping controls. |

#### Why cdk-nag and not cfn-guard or Checkov

cdk-nag is the most actively maintained CDK-native compliance gate and the only serious entrant in its category. Two adjacent tools come up in conversation, and both are deliberately *not* layered on top here:

| Tool | Architecture | Rule language | Suppression UX |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **cdk-nag** (in use) | CDK Aspects, walks the construct tree at synth time | TypeScript / Python rules shipped in the cdk-nag package | Native CDK API — `NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions(...)` with reason strings, per-resource or stack-level, supports `apply_to_children=True` |
| **[cdk-validator-cfnguard](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-validator-cfnguard)** | `PolicyValidationPluginBeta1` plugin, runs the [cfn-guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard) binary against the synthesized CFN JSON | [Guard DSL](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-guard-rules-registry) (declarative `.guard` files) | CFN template metadata (`Metadata.guard.SuppressedRules`) or CLI skip flags — no CDK-aware ergonomics |
| **[cdk-validator-checkov](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-validator-checkov)** | Same plugin pattern, wraps [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) | Python rules (Checkov's 1,000+ rule database across many cloud providers) | Comments in synthesized JSON or CLI flags — same ergonomic gap as cfn-guard |

The two plugin wrappers are *architecturally newer* (the `PolicyValidationPluginBeta1` framework post-dates cdk-nag's Aspects pattern) but they're a different category: they bolt CFN-template scanners onto CDK after synthesis. They lose the CDK-aware view (construct tree, parent/child relationships, pre-synth attributes), and they introduce a second suppression model that doesn't compose with the cdk-nag suppressions already in this repo. The compliance content also overlaps heavily — NIST 800-53 R5, HIPAA Security, and PCI DSS 3.2.1 are all available in both ecosystems.

**When adding a plugin wrapper would make sense (not the case here):**

- You want one of the [aws-guard-rules-registry](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-guard-rules-registry) packs that cdk-nag doesn't ship (see below) — Control Tower Detective Guardrails, FedRAMP Moderate/High, CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, ABS CCIG, Bank of Canada CCB, AWS Well-Architected, plus AWS Config-rule conversions.
- Your security team already authors policies in Guard DSL and you want the same `.guard` files enforced across CDK / SAM / Terraform-converted-to-CFN pipelines.
- You're validating CloudFormation generated *outside* CDK and want one tool for everything.

##### What's in `aws-guard-rules-registry`

The registry is AWS's open-source library of cfn-guard rule packs covering compliance frameworks, AWS service guardrails, and mass conversions of AWS Config managed rules into Guard DSL. The breadth is its main differentiator over cdk-nag — Config alone has hundreds of managed rules, all converted and grouped here. The downside is that mechanically-translated rules are noisier than hand-written equivalents, and the suppression model is template metadata rather than CDK-native API calls.

Notable rule packs (not exhaustive):

| Pack | Focus | cdk-nag overlap |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Control Tower Detective Guardrails** | The Detective Guardrails published by AWS Control Tower (root account, IAM, encryption, logging) | Partial — overlaps `AwsSolutionsChecks` on the IAM/encryption side; the Control Tower-specific account-level rules have no cdk-nag equivalent |
| **FedRAMP Moderate** | NIST 800-53 R4 controls applicable to FedRAMP Moderate baseline | High — most rules are NIST 800-53 R4/R5 controls already covered by cdk-nag's `NIST80053R5Checks` (FedRAMP Moderate is essentially a NIST R4 subset with FedRAMP-specific procedural overlay; the R5 pack covers most of the technical control gap) |
| **FedRAMP High** | NIST 800-53 R4 controls applicable to FedRAMP High baseline | High — same as FedRAMP Moderate plus stricter audit/logging/CloudTrail requirements (multi-region trail, log file validation, ≥1-year retention) |
| **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark** | CIS hardening recommendations for AWS — IAM, CloudTrail, Config, monitoring | Moderate — IAM/encryption rules overlap; CIS-specific monitoring rules (CloudTrail metric filters, password policy, etc.) have no cdk-nag equivalent |
| **HIPAA Security** | HIPAA Security Rule controls | Full — cdk-nag's `HIPAASecurityChecks` covers the same controls |
| **PCI DSS 3.2.1** | PCI DSS controls | Full — cdk-nag's `PCIDSS321Checks` covers the same controls |
| **NIST 800-53 R4 / R5** | NIST controls (generic, not FedRAMP-specific) | Full — cdk-nag's `NIST80053R5Checks` (and `NIST80053R4Checks` if enabled) covers the same controls |
| **AWS Well-Architected** | Mappings against the Well-Architected Framework pillars | None — no cdk-nag equivalent |
| **AWS Config managed rule conversions** | Hundreds of Config managed rules translated to Guard DSL | Partial — many overlap NIST/HIPAA/PCI; the residual is broad-coverage AWS service rules cdk-nag doesn't ship |

##### What FedRAMP would actually buy on top of cdk-nag

FedRAMP Moderate and High are AWS's profiles for federal-government workloads. Both derive from NIST 800-53 — Moderate ≈ NIST 800-53 Moderate baseline; High ≈ NIST 800-53 High baseline plus extra audit/availability controls — so the bulk of the *technical* control content is already enforced by cdk-nag's `NIST80053R5Checks` pack. The FedRAMP-specific gaps in this reference architecture would be:

- **CloudTrail multi-region trail with log file validation** (FedRAMP requires this on the account; not enforced at the resource level by cdk-nag).
- **CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs retention ≥ 1 year** (cdk-nag doesn't enforce a specific retention floor).
- **AWS Backup plan with cross-region copy** for stateful resources (cdk-nag flags `DynamoDBInBackupPlan` but doesn't require cross-region; this stack uses PITR instead and that suppression is documented above).
- **VPC flow logs on every VPC** (N/A here — this stack is fully serverless).
- **IAM password policy / MFA on root account** (account-level, not stack-level — neither cdk-nag nor cfn-guard can enforce this from a stack template).

Most of these are either N/A (no VPC, no root-account-level rules in a template), already implemented (encryption, logging), or covered procedurally rather than at the CFN level (CloudTrail and Backup are typically deployed account-wide, not per-stack). Adding the FedRAMP packs to *this* stack would surface ~zero net-new actionable findings; it would matter for an account intended for FedRAMP authorization, which a public reference architecture isn't.

For a serverless reference architecture already invested in the cdk-nag suppression model — `CDK_LAMBDA_SUPPRESSIONS`, `suppress_cdk_singletons`, per-construct `add_resource_suppressions` calls, the four-pack `apply_compliance_aspects` aspect — layering a second validator would be net-negative: duplicate findings, two allow-lists to maintain, no unique rule coverage gained. cdk-nag stays as the sole compliance gate.

#### Suppressions

Suppressions live in the stack file via `NagSuppressions.add_stack_suppressions` (stack-wide) or `add_resource_suppressions`/`add_resource_suppressions_by_path` (targeted). Each entry has a `reason` explaining why it was suppressed rather than fixed.

Stack-level suppressions are reserved for findings that are genuinely stack-wide (e.g. no custom domain, no VPC by design). Everything else is suppressed at the resource level to keep the blast radius small. CDK-managed singleton Lambdas (BucketDeployment provider, S3AutoDeleteObjects, AwsCustomResource) share a common list in `hello_world/nag_utils.py` (`CDK_LAMBDA_SUPPRESSIONS`), targeted by stable construct IDs via `add_resource_suppressions_by_path`. `AwsSolutions-IAM5` suppressions on `HelloWorldFunction` use `applies_to` to scope to specific wildcard actions rather than suppressing all IAM5 findings.

Every log group — including singleton Lambdas' — is pre-created in CDK and passed via `log_group=` instead of the legacy `log_retention=` path (which creates an unencrypted group through the `LogRetention` singleton). This closes the `*-CloudWatchLogGroupEncrypted` finding without an Aspect-level suppression.

**CMK encryption boundary.** All CloudWatch log groups (Lambda, API Gateway access/execution, WAF, auto-delete Lambda, BucketDeployment provider, AwsCustomResource provider) use customer-managed KMS keys with 90-day rotation. Lambda environment variables are CMK-encrypted via `environment_encryption=` so the security boundary stays in one key rather than splitting across the AWS-managed default. DynamoDB and the frontend S3 bucket use the same CMK. Athena query results in `athena-results/` use SSE-KMS via per-object override on the SSE-S3 bucket. The access-log bucket itself uses SSE-S3 because the S3 log delivery service doesn't support KMS-encrypted target buckets. SSM parameters can't use CMK (CFN doesn't support SecureString creation). AppConfig hosted configs use AWS-managed keys (no CDK CMK option).

Current suppressions across all stacks:

| Rule | Stack | Scope | Why suppressed |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|
| `AwsSolutions-APIG2` | Backend | Stack | Request validation not needed for sample app |
| `AwsSolutions-APIG3` | Backend | Stack | WAF applied at CloudFront, not directly on API Gateway |
| `AwsSolutions-APIG4` | Backend | Stack | No authorizer — auth is out of scope for this sample |
| `AwsSolutions-COG4` | Backend | Stack | No Cognito authorizer — same as APIG4 |
| `AwsSolutions-COG7` | Frontend | Resource (`RumIdentityPool`) | RUM requires unauthenticated guest credentials — anonymous visitors have no prior identity |
| `AwsSolutions-IAM4` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons + HelloWorldFunction) | CDK-managed Lambda roles use AWS managed policies; not configurable by the caller |
| `AwsSolutions-IAM5` | Backend, Frontend, WAF | Per-resource (with `applies_to`) | Wildcard permissions scoped to specific actions — X-Ray, KMS `GenerateDataKey*`/`ReEncrypt*`, CDK custom resource `Resource::*` |
| `AwsSolutions-L1` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons) | CDK-managed Lambda runtimes are not configurable; `HelloWorldFunction` uses Python 3.13 (latest) but cdk-nag rule not yet updated |
| `AwsSolutions-S1` | Frontend | Resource (log bucket) | The access log bucket itself — logging to itself would be circular |
| `AwsSolutions-CFR1` | Frontend | Stack | Geo restriction not required for sample app |
| `AwsSolutions-CFR4` | Frontend | Stack | Default CloudFront certificate — no custom domain for sample app |
| `Serverless-LambdaDLQ` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons) | CDK-managed Lambdas — DLQ is not configurable; `HelloWorldFunction` is synchronously invoked via API Gateway |
| `Serverless-LambdaDefaultMemorySize` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons) | CDK-managed singleton Lambdas — memory is not configurable; `HelloWorldFunction` uses explicit 256 MB |
| `Serverless-LambdaLatestVersion` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons) | CDK-managed Lambda runtimes are not configurable |
| `Serverless-LambdaTracing` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons only) | CDK-managed provider Lambdas do not expose tracing config; `HelloWorldFunction` passes natively |
| `Serverless-APIGWDefaultThrottling` | Backend | Stack | Custom throttling not configured for sample app |
| `CdkNagValidationFailure` | Backend | Stack | Intrinsic function reference prevents `Serverless-APIGWStructuredLogging` from validating |

| `NIST.800.53.R5-LambdaInsideVPC` | Backend, Frontend | Per-resource (CDK singletons) | CDK-managed singleton Lambdas — VPC is not configurable |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-IAMNoInlinePolicy` | Backend, Frontend, WAF | Per-resource | CDK-generated inline policies on singleton service roles — not directly configurable; also suppressed on `RumUnauthenticatedRole` where the single least-privilege `rum:PutRumEvents` policy is tightly bound to the role's one purpose |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-APIGWAssociatedWithWAF` | Backend | Stack | WAF applied at CloudFront, not directly on API Gateway |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-APIGWSSLEnabled` | Backend | Stack | Client-side SSL certificates not required for sample app |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-APIGWCacheEnabledAndEncrypted` | Backend | Stack | API Gateway cache cluster intentionally disabled — smallest size is ~$14/month for a sample app, and caching `GET /hello` would serve stale values across SSM parameter and AppConfig feature-flag changes |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-DynamoDBInBackupPlan` | Backend | Stack | AWS Backup plan not configured; PITR is enabled for point-in-time recovery |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-S3BucketLoggingEnabled` | Frontend | Resource (log bucket) | The access log bucket itself — logging to itself would be circular |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-S3BucketReplicationEnabled` | Frontend | Stack + Resource | Static assets are redeployable; replication not needed |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-S3BucketVersioningEnabled` | Frontend | Stack + Resource | Static assets are redeployable via `cdk deploy`; versioning not needed |
| `NIST.800.53.R5-S3DefaultEncryptionKMS` | Frontend | Resource (log bucket only) | S3 log delivery service does not support KMS target buckets; SSE-S3 required |
| `HIPAA.Security-*` | — | Mirrors the NIST R5 rows above | Every HIPAA Security finding duplicates a NIST R5 counterpart with the same reason (e.g. `HIPAA.Security-LambdaInsideVPC` ↔ `NIST.800.53.R5-LambdaInsideVPC`); suppressions are in the same locations as their NIST R5 twins |
| `PCI.DSS.321-*` | — | Mirrors the NIST R5 rows above | Same as HIPAA — each PCI finding duplicates a NIST R5 counterpart (e.g. `PCI.DSS.321-S3BucketVersioningEnabled` ↔ `NIST.800.53.R5-S3BucketVersioningEnabled`) and is suppressed alongside it |

Rules previously suppressed and since implemented are removed from this list. New suppressions should include a clear `reason` and consider whether the finding represents a genuine gap to fix in production.

#### CDK context flags (`cdk.json`)

CDK uses context flags to opt into newer template-generation behaviors. The `cdk.json` context block has three groups:

- **Original flags (from project creation):** `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda:recognizeLayerVersion`, `@aws-cdk/core:checkSecretUsage`, `@aws-cdk/core:target-partitions`. Shipped with the CDK Python template.
- **Safe flags (zero template drift):** 12 additional flags that CDK 2.248.0 recommends and that produce no CloudFormation changes against the deployed stacks (validated via `cdk diff --all` with each flag enabled, zero diffs). They cover improved validation, metadata collection, unique resource naming, and scoped KMS/DynamoDB/Lambda/CloudFront/API Gateway behaviors.
- **Template-changing flags (deployed):** 7 flags that produce real CloudFormation mutations — validated with `cdk diff --all`, deployed, and confirmed by integration tests:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `@aws-cdk/core:enablePartitionLiterals` | Hardcodes `arn:aws:` partition ARNs instead of `{"Ref": "AWS::Partition"}` |
| `@aws-cdk/aws-s3:serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy` | Migrates S3 access-log delivery from legacy ACL to bucket policy |
| `@aws-cdk/aws-s3:createDefaultLoggingPolicy` | Adds default logging policy to S3 buckets |
| `@aws-cdk/aws-s3:publicAccessBlockedByDefault` | Adds explicit public access block configuration |
| `@aws-cdk/custom-resources:logApiResponseDataPropertyTrueDefault` | Sets `logApiResponseData` to `false` by default for custom resources |
| `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda:createNewPoliciesWithAddToRolePolicy` | Creates separate IAM policy resources per `addToRolePolicy` call for finer-grained control |
| `@aws-cdk/aws-iam:minimizePolicies` | Consolidates IAM policy statements for tighter, least-privilege policies |

**Skipped flag:** `@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:disableCloudWatchRole` is intentionally **not** enabled. It removes the account-level CloudWatch role for API Gateway, which is incompatible with NIST 800-53 R5 — execution logging (`AwsSolutions-APIG6` / `APIGWExecutionLoggingEnabled`) requires that role.

#### Commit `cdk.context.json`

`cdk.context.json` (distinct from the `cdk.json` context block above) caches environmental lookups (AZs, AMI IDs, hosted zones, SSM values) that CDK resolves at synth time. **Commit it on purpose** ([AWS context guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/context.html)): the same cached values must be used across every synth of a commit, or templates drift by machine.

If gitignored, the first synth after a fresh clone re-resolves every lookup against live AWS APIs and rewrites the file — two engineers on the same commit could produce different CloudFormation, and CI could produce a third. Committing pins the values so synth is deterministic. To refresh a cached value, `cdk context --reset <key>` and commit the diff.

### pyproject.toml configuration

All tool configuration is consolidated in `pyproject.toml`. Here is a summary of the key settings in each section:

#### `[tool.ruff]`

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `target-version` | `py313` | Enables Python 3.13-specific lint rules and syntax modernization |
| `line-length` | `120` | Maximum line length enforced by the formatter |
| `dummy-variable-rgx` | `^(_+\|...)$` | Allows `_`-prefixed variables to be unused without triggering a lint warning |

#### `[tool.ruff.lint]`

Ruff is configured with a broad set of rule groups. Each group targets a specific class of issue:

| Code | Plugin | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `E` / `W` | pycodestyle | Style errors and warnings |
| `F` | pyflakes | Undefined names, unused imports |
| `I` | isort | Import ordering |
| `C` | flake8-comprehensions | Inefficient list/dict/set comprehensions |
| `B` | flake8-bugbear | Likely bugs and design issues |
| `S` | flake8-bandit | Security anti-patterns |
| `UP` | pyupgrade | Modernize syntax to the target Python version |
| `SIM` | flake8-simplify | Suggest simpler code patterns |
| `RUF` | ruff-specific | Ruff's own opinionated rules |
| `T20` | flake8-print | Catches `print()` calls — use Powertools Logger instead |
| `PT` | flake8-pytest-style | Enforces pytest conventions (fixtures, raises, etc.) |
| `N` | pep8-naming | Naming conventions (snake_case, PascalCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE) |
| `RET` | flake8-return | Unnecessary `else` after `return`, redundant return values |

#### `[tool.mypy]`

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `warn_return_any` | Warns when a typed function returns `Any`, which often masks missing type coverage |
| `warn_unused_ignores` | Warns when a `# type: ignore` comment is no longer needed, preventing stale suppression comments |
| `disallow_untyped_defs` | Every function must have complete type annotations |
| `check_untyped_defs` | Type-checks function bodies even if the function itself lacks annotations |
| `no_implicit_optional` | `f(x: str = None)` does not implicitly mean `Optional[str]` — must be explicit |
| `ignore_missing_imports` | Suppresses errors for third-party packages without type stubs (e.g. aws-lambda-powertools) |
| `show_error_codes` | Prints `[error-code]` next to each error — required to write precise `# type: ignore[code]` comments |

#### `[tool.pylint.design]`

Structural complexity thresholds. Pylint fails if any function or class exceeds these limits. Complexity is also enforced by the xenon pre-commit hook (which uses radon under the hood).

| Threshold | Value | What it limits |
|---|---|---|
| `max-args` | 8 | Parameters per function |
| `max-locals` | 25 | Local variables per function |
| `max-returns` | 6 | Return statements per function |
| `max-branches` | 12 | Branches (if/for/while/try) per function |
| `max-statements` | 50 | Statements per function body |
| `max-attributes` | 10 | Instance attributes per class |

#### `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`

Key flags in `addopts`:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-ra` | Prints a short summary of all non-passed tests (failures, errors, skipped) at the end |
| `--cov=lambda` | Measures coverage for the `lambda/` directory |
| `--cov-branch` | Tracks branch coverage — not just whether a line ran, but whether all conditional paths did |
| `--cov-fail-under=100` | Fails the run if total coverage drops below 100% |
| `--no-cov-on-fail` | Skips coverage reporting when tests fail (avoids misleading partial results) |
| `-n auto` | Runs tests in parallel across all available CPU cores (pytest-xdist) |

`log_cli = true` and `log_cli_level = "WARNING"` stream log output in real time during the test run, showing only WARNING and above to reduce noise.

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

Four workflows are configured:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **CI** | Push / PR to `main` | Three jobs: pre-commit hooks (`quality`), pytest unit tests (`test`), CDK synth + stack assertion tests (`cdk-check`) |
| **Docs** | Push to `main` | Builds Zensical docs, deploys to GitHub Pages |
| **Dependency Audit** | Every Monday 9am UTC | Runs `pip-audit` against each dependency group exported from `uv.lock` |
| **Dependabot Auto-merge** | Dependabot PRs | Approves and auto-merges patch/minor `github_actions`, `uv`, and `pip` updates when CI passes; majors stay manual. Gated on PR *opener* (not latest pusher) so maintainer pushes via `make deps-merge` don't disarm it |

All three CI jobs must pass before merge to `main` (branch protection).

Each job uses `uv sync --locked` so it fails loudly if `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are out of sync rather than silently regenerating mid-build:
- **`quality`** — `--group cdk --group test --group lint --group docs` (runs pre-commit hooks covering every tool)
- **`test`** — `--only-group lambda --only-group test` into `.venv-lambda` via `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-lambda` (isolates Powertools `attrs>=26` from CDK `attrs<26`)
- **`cdk-check`** — `--group cdk --group test` + CDK CLI via `npm install -g aws-cdk`; runs `cdk synth` (catches unsuppressed cdk-nag findings) then `tests/cdk/test_stacks.py` (assertion tests via `aws_cdk.assertions.Template`). Asset bundling skipped via `aws:cdk:bundling-stacks` context key so it runs without Docker. Lives under `tests/cdk/` rather than `tests/unit/` so the unit-test autouse fixture doesn't apply — the job intentionally omits Powertools to dodge the `attrs` conflict.

Each job ends with `uv cache prune --ci`, which drops pre-built wheels (cheap to redownload) and keeps source distributions (expensive to rebuild), shrinking the `actions/cache` artifact between runs.

#### Dependabot

`.github/dependabot.yml` checks for updates every Monday across three ecosystems:

| Ecosystem | What it checks | Auto-merge? |
|---|---|---|
| `github-actions` | Workflow YAML for newer action versions (`actions/checkout@v4` → `v5`) | Patch/minor auto-merge once CI passes; majors require human review |
| `uv` | `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` — every dependency group in one lock, regenerated atomically | Patch/minor auto-merge once CI passes; majors require human review. Updates touching the `lambda` runtime group (`boto*`, `aws-lambda-powertools`) need a one-time `make lock` push first — see "Python (uv) updates" below |
| `pre-commit` | `rev:` field on each remote pre-commit hook | Patch/minor auto-merge once CI passes |

The `dependabot-auto-merge` workflow approves + arms auto-merge when **all** of:

1. The PR's *opener* is Dependabot (`github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'`). Gating on opener (not `github.actor`, the latest pusher) keeps the workflow eligible across maintainer follow-up pushes — e.g. `make deps-merge`'s `make lock` regenerations on Dependabot branches.
2. `dependabot/fetch-metadata` reports the ecosystem as `github_actions`, `uv`, or `pip`. Both `uv` and `pip` are accepted because Dependabot's `uv` ecosystem reports `pip` in `fetch-metadata` output (uv builds on pip's resolver).
3. The update type is `version-update:semver-patch` or `version-update:semver-minor`.

The metadata action is configured with `skip-commit-verification: true` because `fetch-metadata` otherwise refuses to proceed when the latest commit isn't signed by Dependabot's GPG key — after a `make deps-merge` push, the latest commit is the maintainer's. The job-level opener gate already protects the author identity.

Once armed, GitHub waits for required status checks (`quality`, `test`, `cdk-check`) and then merges. If any check fails, the PR stays open with auto-merge unsatisfied — surfacing the failure rather than silently merging. Majors fall through to manual review because cooldowns catch malicious releases but not intentional API breaks.

**Repo setting required for auto-merge.** Enable **Settings → Actions → General → "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** once per repo. Without it, the workflow fails with `GraphQL: GitHub Actions is not permitted to approve pull requests`. Leave **Workflow permissions** at **Read repository contents and packages permissions** (safer default) — every workflow declares its own `permissions:` block, so the elevated default is unnecessary. See "Least-privilege workflow permissions" below.

##### Python (`uv`) updates

All Python dependencies live in `pyproject.toml` across five groups (`lambda`, `cdk`, `test`, `lint`, `docs`) and resolve into one `uv.lock`. `[tool.uv.conflicts]` declares `lambda` and `cdk` as mutually exclusive so uv records two resolutions for the `attrs` conflict in the same lock and installs the right one per venv. Dependabot regenerates `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` together in a single PR — no pip-tools constraint chain.

**Grouped updates** in `dependabot.yml` bundle related packages: `aws-cdk*`/`constructs`, `aws-*`/`boto*`/`botocore`/`s3transfer`, `pytest`+plugins, docs tooling, linting tooling, and a weekly "patches" PR for everything else. Within a group, `uv.lock` regenerates in one shot — no cross-package skew between boto3+botocore+aws-lambda-powertools. Majors outside these groups still get individual PRs so each changelog can be reviewed.

**When a `make lock` push is required.** The deployed Lambda installs from a flat `lambda/requirements.txt` (CDK's `PythonFunction` construct expects one), generated from `uv.lock` via `uv export --only-group lambda --no-emit-project`. The `quality` CI job re-runs that export and fails if the committed file drifts — preventing a stale `requirements.txt` from shipping when Dependabot bumps a runtime dep.

Dependabot updates `uv.lock` but **not** the exported `requirements.txt`, so any uv PR touching the `lambda` group (`aws-lambda-powertools`, `boto*`, `botocore`, `aws-encryption-sdk`, etc.) fails the drift check on first CI run. The PR sits open with auto-merge armed, waiting.

Unblock with `make deps-merge`, which automates the rebase + `make lock` + push + arm-auto-merge loop:

```bash
make deps-merge            # process every open Dependabot PR
make deps-merge PR=42      # process only PR #42 (skips the wait between PRs)
```

Per PR: sync main → checkout PR branch → rebase → `make lock` → `uv run ruff format .` (catches reformatter drift from ruff bumps) → commit + force-push → arm `gh pr merge --auto --squash`. When processing all, it waits for each merge before moving on so subsequent PRs rebase onto a main that already includes their predecessors — sequential is required because every `make lock` regenerates `uv.lock` and concurrent processing would clobber predecessors at squash time. PRs that rebase-conflict, fail `make lock`, or fail CI are skipped with a clear log line; the script never `--admin`-bypasses failing checks. Manual equivalent:

```bash
gh pr checkout <pr-number>
make lock                                  # regenerates lambda/requirements.txt
git add lambda/requirements.txt && git commit -m "chore: regenerate lambda/requirements.txt" && git push
```

PRs touching only non-lambda groups (`aws-cdk`, `pytest`, `docs`, `linting`) don't drift `lambda/requirements.txt` and merge with zero maintainer involvement.

**Why this compromise.** A Personal Access Token could let the workflow regenerate + push automatically (the auto-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` deliberately doesn't retrigger workflows on its own pushes), but adds a long-lived credential to rotate. Treating `lambda/requirements.txt` as a fully-generated artifact would remove the drift check, but adds a build step before every `cdk synth` and forfeits the pinned-dependency-set-at-any-commit property. The current setup keeps credential surface and build pipeline unchanged at the cost of one occasional manual step. Always run `make lock` after changing `pyproject.toml` — never hand-edit `lambda/requirements.txt`.

**Useful Dependabot commands.** Comment `@dependabot rebase` on a stale PR (shown `BEHIND` in `gh pr view`) to trigger fresh rebase + CI. Other useful commands: `@dependabot recreate` (regenerate from scratch) and `@dependabot ignore this version`. Full list: <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates>.

##### Supply-chain hardening

This repo layers six defenses against the supply-chain attack patterns described in GitGuardian's [*Renovate & Dependabot: the new malware delivery system*](https://blog.gitguardian.com/renovate-dependabot-the-new-malware-delivery-system/):

**1. Release cooldown.** Every ecosystem in `dependabot.yml` carries a `cooldown:` block that makes Dependabot wait a few days after a release before opening a PR. Fresh releases are the window in which malicious versions (tag hijacks, compromised maintainer accounts, typo-squats, the `xz-utils`/`nx`/`tj-actions/changed-files` class of incidents) typically get caught and yanked. The tiered schedule is 3 days for patches, 7 for minors, 14 for majors — larger jumps wait longer to let bugs surface.

**2. SHA-pinned GitHub Actions.** Every `uses:` reference in `.github/workflows/` is pinned to a 40-character commit SHA with the version in a trailing comment:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd  # v6.0.2
```

Tag references are mutable — a compromised maintainer account can rewrite `v6` to point at malicious code, and every workflow that said `@v6` instantly runs the malicious version on the next trigger. This is exactly what happened to `tj-actions/changed-files` in March 2025, where attackers rewrote the `v35` and `v38` tags to exfiltrate CI secrets from thousands of repos within an hour. SHA pins are immutable — a re-tagged release becomes a new commit, and our pin simply ignores it until a human updates it. Dependabot still opens update PRs for SHA-pinned actions; the diff replaces both the SHA and the version comment in one shot.

**3. Hash-locked installs.** `uv.lock` records a SHA256 for every wheel and sdist it resolves, and `uv sync` refuses to install anything whose on-disk hash does not match. The `lambda/requirements.txt` artifact exported from the lock for the deployed Lambda is generated with hashes too. Even if an attacker uploads a malicious version under an existing version number (e.g. after yanking the legitimate one), the install refuses it because the hash does not match.

**4. Restricted auto-merge.** Auto-merge is scoped to patch and minor updates only — never majors. Both ecosystems (GitHub Actions and uv) qualify, but uv updates that touch the `lambda` runtime group fail CI's `lambda/requirements.txt` drift check and require a one-time `make lock` push before they can merge (see "Python (`uv`) updates" above). The drift check is what makes uv auto-merge safe: it physically blocks any uv lock change from reaching `main` until the exported requirements file that the production Lambda actually installs from has been regenerated and reviewed alongside the lock. Combined with the cooldown (#1), the SHA pins (#2), and the hash-locked installs (#3), a malicious uv release cannot land on `main` without surviving 3–14 days of cooldown, hash verification at install time, and (for runtime deps) the human-driven `make lock` step.

**5. Local cooldown on `make upgrade`.** Dependabot's cooldown protects every dependency change that lands via a PR, but `make upgrade` runs locally on a developer laptop and bypasses Dependabot entirely. The Makefile mirrors the same defense by passing uv's `--exclude-newer` flag to `uv lock --upgrade`, filtering out any package version uploaded after a cutoff computed from `COOLDOWN_DAYS` (default 7). Override at the command line if you need to pull a fresher version: `make upgrade COOLDOWN_DAYS=1`. The cooldown is intentionally **only** applied to `upgrade`, not `lock`. `lock` reproduces decisions already encoded in `pyproject.toml` and the existing `uv.lock` — it cannot introduce a brand-new version, so cooldown is unnecessary and would actively conflict with freshly-bumped pins. `upgrade` is the only target where new versions enter the project and is the only place a fresh malicious release can land. Disable entirely with `COOLDOWN_DAYS=0`.

**6. Least-privilege workflow permissions.** Every workflow under `.github/workflows/` declares an explicit `permissions:` block scoped to exactly what it needs, and the repo-level default (`Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions`) is set to `read` rather than `write`. The combination means that if a malicious dependency runs inside a CI job, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` it sees has the minimum authority necessary — `ci.yml`, `dependency-audit.yml`, and `docs.yml`'s `build` job all run with `contents: read` and nothing else. Only two places escalate beyond read: `docs.yml`'s `deploy` job adds `pages: write` + `id-token: write` for GitHub Pages OIDC deployment, and `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` adds `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` so it can approve and merge Dependabot PRs (and is gated on `github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'` plus a patch/minor update-type check). Permissions are declared at the **job** level wherever a workflow has heterogeneous needs (docs.yml's build vs deploy) and at the **workflow** level otherwise. The repo-level `read` default acts as defense-in-depth: if any future workflow is added without an explicit `permissions:` block, it inherits `read` instead of write-everything. The repo separately keeps `can_approve_pull_request_reviews` enabled — that toggle is independent of the default and is required for the auto-merge workflow's `gh pr review --approve` call to succeed.

**What's intentionally not implemented: honeytokens.** The article also recommends honeytokens as a detection layer, which this repo deliberately skips. A honeytoken is a fake credential — typically an AWS access key or GitHub token that looks completely real but is registered with a canary service (Thinkst, GitGuardian, AWS canarytokens.org). Nothing legitimate ever authenticates with it, so any use is by definition either an attacker or a misconfigured script that shouldn't exist. When someone tries it, the canary service alerts the owner with the timestamp, source IP, and which specific token fired — that last detail reveals *where* the attacker read it from (CI logs, a specific repo clone, a leaked `.env`, etc.), which makes incident scoping much faster.

Honeytokens are specifically effective against the CI-exfiltration pattern this hardening section guards against: a malicious dependency running inside a CI runner typically sweeps environment variables and filesystem paths for anything that looks like a credential and pipes it to an attacker-controlled endpoint. If a honeytoken is reachable from the same runner (e.g. planted in `.github/workflows/` as a fake `DEPLOY_KEY` secret, or embedded in a committed `.env.example` file), the exfiltration tooling scoops it up alongside the real credentials and the alert fires within seconds of the breach — weeks before an attacker would otherwise tip their hand by actually using the stolen credentials.

Everything else in this section is *prevention*; honeytokens are *detection*. They do not stop attacks, they tell you an attack happened. The reason this repo skips them is not value but operational overhead: honeytokens are easy to plant (canarytokens.org generates one in about 30 seconds) but the alert routing is the real cost. You need somewhere for the alert to land (email you actually read, a Slack channel you watch, a pager), and you need a runbook for what to do when it fires. For a solo reference project with no production data, no customer PII, and CI secrets that can be rotated in 30 seconds, that plumbing is not worth standing up. For any repo running real workloads — production AWS accounts, customer data, deploy keys to anything that ships to users — honeytokens are a high-signal, low-noise addition that pays for itself the first time one fires, and GitGuardian's free `ggshield` CLI ships a generator that integrates with their alert console.

**What's intentionally not implemented: machine inventory.** The article recommends maintaining an inventory of every machine that runs unattended `pip install` / `npm install`, because each one is an exfiltration surface if a malicious package lands. At org scale this matters — dozens of build boxes, dev laptops with auto-updaters, and shared CI fleets each multiply the blast radius. For this repo the inventory is two items: one developer laptop and GitHub-hosted runners (which are ephemeral and Microsoft's problem). Writing that down as a doc would add a file to keep in sync with zero defensive value at this scale, so it is deliberately omitted. If this pattern is extended to a team or org repo, the inventory should be revisited and probably codified.

**What's intentionally not implemented: a post-compromise rotation runbook.** The article also recommends a written checklist for "assume a malicious dep ran in CI — what do I rotate, in what order, how fast?" The value of writing it down ahead of time is that during an actual incident, you are panicked and will forget steps. This repo deliberately skips the runbook because it currently has nothing to rotate: the only secret in use is the auto-scoped per-run `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which expires when each job ends. There are no AWS deploy keys, no API tokens, no `secrets.*` entries with real credentials. A runbook today would read "revoke nothing, there's nothing to revoke." The moment a real secret is added to this repo (an AWS deploy role, a Sentry DSN, anything in `secrets.*`), this section should become a runbook with the rotation order, who to notify, and the commands to run.

##### Why not Renovate?

[Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) is an alternative to Dependabot that historically handled multi-file Python setups more gracefully. With the migration to a single `uv.lock`, most of that advantage no longer applies — Dependabot's uv ecosystem regenerates the lock atomically in one PR. The remaining differences are at the edges:

- Renovate supports richer grouping rules (e.g., regex-based bundling, per-manager overrides) and auto-merge rules scoped by update type (patch/minor/major) for Python PRs.
- Renovate runs as a GitHub App, so it is zero-infrastructure.

This project uses Dependabot because it is the GitHub-native default and already integrated into the repo for GitHub Actions updates. The `uv` ecosystem support closed the gap that previously made Renovate compelling for the pip-tools constraint chain. The remaining Renovate edge is its [post-upgrade tasks](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#postupgradetasks) feature, which lets the bot regenerate `lambda/requirements.txt` in the same PR commit as the `uv.lock` bump (eliminating the manual `make lock` push that lambda-runtime updates currently require). For this repo the trade-off didn't pencil out — keeping a single bot integrated with GitHub-native auto-merge is simpler than running two — but a higher-volume production repo that wanted fully unattended uv merges would find Renovate's post-upgrade tasks worth installing for that one feature.

## Project dependencies

Managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) in [project mode](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/). All direct deps live in `pyproject.toml` under five [PEP 735 dependency groups](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/); the resolved graph (with hashes for every wheel and sdist) lives in `uv.lock`.

| Group | Purpose | Installed into |
|---|---|---|
| `lambda` | Lambda runtime (Powertools, boto3, X-Ray SDK) | `.venv-lambda` |
| `cdk` | CDK core, constructs, cdk-nag, cdk-monitoring-constructs | `.venv` |
| `test` | pytest, coverage, xdist, mock, html, timeout, randomly | both venvs |
| `lint` | ruff, mypy, pylint, bandit, radon, xenon, pre-commit, pip-audit, boto3-stubs | `.venv` |
| `docs` | zensical + mkdocstrings | `.venv` |

**Two venvs, one lock file.** `[tool.uv].conflicts = [[{group = "lambda"}, {group = "cdk"}]]` declares the groups mutually exclusive so uv records **both** valid resolutions of the `attrs` conflict (25.4.0 CDK, 26.1.0 Powertools) in one `uv.lock` and installs the right one per venv. The Makefile switches between them by setting `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-lambda` for Lambda-side commands. `make install` provisions both.

**`lambda/requirements.txt` is a generated artifact** — CDK's `PythonFunction` bundles Lambda deps from a flat requirements file at deploy time. `make lock` runs `uv export --only-group lambda --no-emit-project --format requirements.txt` after every `uv lock`. Never hand-edit.

Common operations:

```bash
make lock                                # regenerate uv.lock + lambda/requirements.txt
make install                             # sync both venvs from the lock
uv add <pkg> --group <group>             # add a dep (updates pyproject.toml + uv.lock atomically)

make upgrade                             # bump all deps, blocking any version <7 days old (cooldown)
make upgrade COOLDOWN_DAYS=14            # stricter (older than 14 days)
make upgrade COOLDOWN_DAYS=0             # disable cooldown
```

`make upgrade` passes `--exclude-newer` to `uv lock --upgrade` so brand-new PyPI releases (the window in which malicious versions typically get yanked) don't enter the lock. See "Local cooldown on `make upgrade`" in supply-chain hardening for the full rationale.

## When forking for production

### Design decisions and known limitations

**`cdk.out/` is not committed** — this directory contains the synthesized CloudFormation template and bundled Lambda assets generated by `cdk synth`. It is gitignored because it is always reproducible from source and can be large. Run `cdk synth` locally to regenerate it before deploying or invoking locally with SAM.

**`cdk synth` must use `'**'` to descend into Stage-nested stacks** — all three stacks live inside `HelloWorldStage` (a `cdk.Stage`), so bare `cdk synth` walks only the App's direct children, finds the Stage, does not recurse, and emits an empty synthesis that succeeds without ever running cdk-nag against the WAF/backend/frontend stacks. `'**'` is the CDK glob pattern for "every stack at every depth"; both `make cdk-synth` and the CI `cdk-check` job use it. If you run `cdk synth` directly during development, include the glob too — otherwise the gate passes silently regardless of what cdk-nag would find against the real stacks.

**attrs version conflict** — CDK (via `jsii`) pins `attrs<26`, while `aws-lambda-powertools[all]>=3.27` requires `attrs>=26`. These two versions cannot coexist in a single Python environment. The project handles this by declaring the `lambda` and `cdk` dependency groups mutually exclusive in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.uv.conflicts]`), which lets uv record both resolutions in a single `uv.lock` (25.4.0 for the CDK side, 26.1.0 for the Lambda side) and install each into its own venv: `.venv` for CDK work and `.venv-lambda` for Lambda runtime code. CI splits into separate `quality`/`cdk-check` (CDK venv) and `test` (Lambda venv) jobs for the same reason.

**SSM parameter name is CDK-generated** — the greeting parameter's name is auto-generated by CDK (derived from the construct path, e.g. `HelloWorld-us-east-1AppGreetingParameterD5E6E64F`) rather than set explicitly. The Lambda reads the name from the `GREETING_PARAM_NAME` env var, which CDK wires up from `greeting_param.parameter_name`, so the name never needs to be human-memorable. This follows the CDK "use generated resource names" best practice — see [Stack and construct composition](#stack-and-construct-composition).

**CORS is open (`allow_origin="*"`)** — the Lambda handler configures `APIGatewayRestResolver` with `CORSConfig(allow_origin="*")` for simplicity. In production, restrict this to the specific CloudFront domain (e.g., `allow_origin="https://d1234.cloudfront.net"`) and set `allow_credentials=True` if the API requires cookies or Authorization headers. Leaving CORS open in production allows any origin to call the API from a browser.

**Error handling** — the handler demonstrates the recommended pattern for production Lambda error handling. Critical downstream failures catch the *specific* expected exception type — `aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.parameters.exceptions.GetParameterError` for the SSM call, which is what Powertools raises after wrapping any underlying `botocore` failure — and re-raise as `InternalServerError` so the API responds with a meaningful HTTP status. Truly unexpected exceptions (anything *not* a `GetParameterError`) intentionally propagate to Powertools' default handler so the original type surfaces in CloudWatch metrics and X-Ray rather than being silently flattened to a generic 500. Non-critical failures (AppConfig feature flag evaluation) fall back to a safe default rather than failing the whole request. As you extend this project, apply the same pattern to any new downstream call: decide whether the failure is critical (catch the specific expected type and raise `InternalServerError`) or non-critical (log a warning, use a default), and add a corresponding unit test for each path.

**Idempotency keys come from a client-supplied `Idempotency-Key` header** — Powertools' `@idempotent` decorator is configured with `event_key_jmespath='headers."Idempotency-Key" || headers."idempotency-key"'` and `raise_on_no_idempotency_key=True`. The OR fallback covers both `Idempotency-Key` and the lowercase `idempotency-key` form (HTTP headers are case-insensitive but API Gateway preserves whatever the caller sent). A request without the header trips Powertools' `IdempotencyKeyError`, which the outer handler catches and converts to a 400 — making the requirement enforced rather than implicit. Keying on a caller-controlled value is what actually makes the layer deduplicate; the obvious-looking `requestContext.requestId` alternative is regenerated by API Gateway on every retry and would cause every call to write a fresh DynamoDB record without ever short-circuiting. Clients should generate the key as a UUID per logical operation (per the [Powertools Idempotency docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powertools/python/latest/utilities/idempotency/)) and reuse it across retries.

**Async failure destination on the AwsCustomResource provider Lambda** — CloudFormation invokes the AwsCustomResource provider singleton asynchronously during stack lifecycle events. Without an `on_failure` destination, a provider crash that exhausts Lambda's two automatic async retries is silently dropped — the CFN rollback still surfaces an error, but the *cause* (Python traceback, AWS API error response) is gone unless someone catches it in CloudWatch within the retention window. Both the backend and frontend stacks attach an SQS DLQ (CMK-encrypted, 14-day retention, SSL-enforced) via `attach_async_failure_destination()` in [hello_world/nag_utils.py](hello_world/nag_utils.py), wired to the singleton's underlying Lambda using `configure_async_invoke(on_failure=destinations.SqsDestination(dlq))`. The failed-event envelope (full request payload + responseContext) lands in the queue for post-mortem.

**Required env vars fail loudly at import time** — every required environment variable (`IDEMPOTENCY_TABLE_NAME`, `APPCONFIG_*`, `GREETING_PARAM_NAME`) is read through a small `_require_env()` helper that raises `RuntimeError` immediately if the value is missing or empty. Without this, a misconfigured deploy only surfaces deep inside boto3 as an opaque parameter-validation error from a downstream call — the kind of failure that takes hours to track to its actual cause. Failing at module load means the misconfiguration shows up in CloudWatch on the very first cold start with the offending variable named in the message.

**RUM client URL floats to `1.x`** — [frontend/index.html](frontend/index.html) loads `https://client.rum.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/1.x/cwr.js` rather than pinning a specific patch version. AWS publishes a major-version-floating path so security and bug-fix patches reach the browser without requiring a frontend redeploy. Pinning to a literal `1.21.0` (or similar) means the only way to pick up a CVE fix is to bump the URL and run `cdk deploy`, which is fine if the project is actively maintained but a problem if it isn't. The major-version float trades the (small) risk of a minor regression in the AWS-shipped client for guaranteed access to security patches. Because the underlying file changes whenever AWS ships a patch, the page intentionally does not put a Subresource Integrity (`integrity=`) hash on the script tag — a fixed SRI hash would break the page on the first patched release. The trust model is "AWS-served domain over TLS 1.2+" rather than "pinned content hash."

**Explicit resource creation prevents dangling resources** — AWS services sometimes create supporting resources outside of CloudFormation. The most common example is CloudWatch log groups: Lambda creates one automatically on first invocation, and API Gateway creates an execution log group (`API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{api-id}/{stage}`) whenever execution logging is enabled. Neither is managed by CloudFormation, so neither is deleted when you run `cdk destroy` — they silently persist and accrue storage costs indefinitely.

Every resource in this stack is declared explicitly in CDK with `removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` so that `cdk destroy` leaves nothing behind. When you add new AWS services, check whether they create their own supporting resources (log groups, S3 buckets, parameter store entries, etc.) and declare those explicitly too. The pattern is: if AWS creates it, CDK should own it.

**Application Insights dashboard** — Application Insights automatically creates a CloudWatch dashboard named after its resource group when `auto_configuration_enabled=True`. This dashboard is created outside of CloudFormation and cannot be pre-declared in CDK. To ensure it is removed on `cdk destroy`, the backend stack includes a Lambda-backed custom resource (`AppInsightsDashboardCleanup`) that calls `DeleteDashboards` at destroy time, targeting the dashboard by the resource group name.

> **Note:** If you ever rename the Application Insights resource group (e.g., by changing the stack name), the dashboard associated with the old name will be left behind because the old custom resource no longer knows about it. Clean it up manually:
>
> ```bash
> # List Application Insights dashboards
> aws cloudwatch list-dashboards --query "DashboardEntries[?contains(DashboardName, 'ApplicationInsights')]"
>
> # Delete the old one
> aws cloudwatch delete-dashboard --dashboard-names "ApplicationInsights-<old-resource-group-name>"
> ```

**CloudWatch RUM auto-created log group** — same dangling-resource shape as Application Insights, different service. RUM creates a log group at `/aws/vendedlogs/RUMService_<monitor-name><first-8-hex-of-monitor-id>` the first time it ingests an event, outside CloudFormation. The frontend stack includes a Lambda-backed custom resource (`RumLogGroupCleanup`) that calls `logs:DeleteLogGroup` at destroy time. The log group name can't be pre-declared in CDK with a known name because RUM appends its own monitor-ID suffix to the name, and the monitor ID is a CFN runtime attribute — `Fn.select(0, Fn.split("-", rum_app_monitor.attr_id))` extracts the 8-hex prefix RUM uses. The IAM policy is scoped to the specific log-group ARN; `ResourceNotFoundException` is ignored so destroy succeeds even when no events were ever ingested (the log group only materializes on first event, common in CI / no-traffic deploys). On destroy, the cleanup CR fires before the AppMonitor is deleted; there's a brief window where new events could re-create the log group, but for any realistic teardown the traffic has already stopped.

> **Note:** If you rename the RUM AppMonitor (e.g., by changing the stack name) and then destroy the old stack, the old log group will be left behind because the renamed cleanup CR no longer knows about it. List and delete manually with `aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/vendedlogs/RUMService_` and `aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name <name>`.

**DynamoDB Contributor Insights is enabled** — `contributor_insights_enabled=True` is set on the `IdempotencyTable`. Contributor Insights is a free CloudWatch feature that surfaces the *most active partition keys* and the *most throttled requests* over rolling time windows. For an idempotency table where the partition key is the API Gateway request ID (effectively unique per call), this means you can see in the AWS Console which request IDs are hitting the table hardest, when retries are concentrating on the same key, and whether any partition is approaching the per-partition write throughput ceiling that triggers throttling on a PAY_PER_REQUEST table. Cost: zero — only enabled-and-active tables incur charges, which kicks in only if the table actually receives write traffic. *Cost/value note:* on this sample with effectively zero RPS, both cost and value are near zero — there are no hot keys to surface in an idle table. The feature pays off at production traffic when hot keys, retries, and per-partition throttling actually happen. Wiring it now means it's already on the day production traffic arrives.

**Lambda runs on arm64 (Graviton)** — the function is configured with `_lambda.Architecture.ARM_64`. Graviton-based Lambda is roughly 20% cheaper per GB-second than x86_64 and tends to deliver ~19% better performance for typical Python workloads. The PythonFunction bundler builds wheels matching the function architecture, so all dependencies (including any C-extension wheels like `pydantic-core` and `cryptography`) install correctly. Switch back to `Architecture.X86_64` only if you add a layer or dependency that's published for x86 only. *Cost/value note:* at sample-app traffic the absolute savings are pennies per month — the change earns its keep by establishing the right default before traffic arrives. At production traffic the same one-line choice compounds into real money.

**AppConfig IAM is fully resource-scoped** — both `appconfig:StartConfigurationSession` and `appconfig:GetLatestConfiguration` are bound to the same `application/{app_id}/environment/{env_id}/configuration/{profile_id}` ARN, built dynamically from the Stack partition/region/account and the AppConfig CFN refs. The session token in `GetLatestConfiguration` request bodies is opaque request data, not the IAM resource — IAM still authorizes the call against the configuration ARN, so a wildcard `Resource: "*"` is unnecessary. The X-Ray segment publish action genuinely has no resource-level ARN and remains the only `Resource: "*"` left in the Lambda's auto-generated policy; that one statement carries the corresponding nag suppression on its own.

**KMS keys rotate automatically every 90 days** — every CMK in the project (backend, frontend, WAF) sets `enable_key_rotation=True` with `rotation_period=Duration.days(90)`. Per the [KMS rotation docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotating-keys-enable.html), rotation is fully managed: AWS retains all prior key versions indefinitely and transparently selects the right one for decryption, the key ID/ARN/policies don't change, and no dependent resources need to be redeployed. 90 days is a common compliance-aligned cadence (PCI/HIPAA forks frequently default there) and the [KMS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/) caps the rotated-material storage charge at the second rotation, so cost is bounded regardless of how often rotation fires.

**Service-principal grants on KMS keys are confused-deputy-guarded** — the `logs.{region}.amazonaws.com` grant on every CMK is conditioned on `kms:EncryptionContext:aws:logs:arn` matching `arn:{partition}:logs:{region}:{account}:log-group:*`, so only log groups in this account+region can use the key. CloudWatch Logs sets that encryption-context key on every encrypt/decrypt call (per the [CloudWatch Logs encryption docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html)). The `cloudtrail.amazonaws.com` grant on the frontend CMK is similarly conditioned on `aws:SourceAccount` matching this account and `aws:SourceArn` matching `arn:{partition}:cloudtrail:{region}:{account}:trail/*`. Without these conditions, any AWS-internal service principal that ever discovered the key ARN could in principle request key operations against it — the conditions make the grants strictly scoped to resources this account actually owns.

**GuardDuty has `kms:Decrypt` on the backend CMK** — the Lambda's env vars are CMK-encrypted (see "Lambda environment variables are CMK-encrypted" below), so GuardDuty Lambda Protection would otherwise hit `AccessDenied` when introspecting the function configuration. The grant lives in `grant_guardduty_service_to_key()` in [hello_world/nag_utils.py](hello_world/nag_utils.py) and is wired from [hello_world/hello_world_app.py](hello_world/hello_world_app.py). It's scoped to detectors in this account+region only via `aws:SourceAccount` + `aws:SourceArn` — the same confused-deputy guard pattern applied to the CloudWatch Logs and CloudTrail grants above. Only the backend CMK carries the statement; the frontend and WAF CMKs encrypt resources GuardDuty does not currently inspect through a CMK. The grant is dormant until GuardDuty Lambda Protection is enabled at the account level (a one-time AWS console / API toggle outside this stack's scope) — the original `AccessDenied` finding in CloudTrail was what flagged the missing grant in the first place.

**CloudTrail trail bucket has an explicit confused-deputy Deny** — CDK 2.248's `cloudtrail.Trail` L2 grants `cloudtrail.amazonaws.com` `s3:GetBucketAcl` + `s3:PutObject` on the destination bucket without an `aws:SourceArn` condition. To close that gap without rebuilding the L2-managed Allow statements, the frontend stack appends **two** Deny statements to the bucket policy: one rejecting the CloudTrail principal whenever `aws:SourceArn` doesn't equal this stack's trail ARN, and a second rejecting it whenever `aws:SourceAccount` doesn't match the account. They live in separate statements on purpose — packing both keys into one `StringNotEquals` block would AND them, so a malicious trail in the same account with a different name would match `aws:SourceAccount` and slip past. Splitting them gives the OR semantics we actually want: either mismatch denies. The trail name is pinned (`{stack-name}-S3DataEventsTrail`) so the ARN is computable before the trail resource is created — without that, the bucket policy would form a dependency cycle with the trail.

**Lambda recursive-loop detection is set explicitly to `Terminate`** — the L2 `PythonFunction` construct doesn't expose this property, so it's set on the underlying `CfnFunction` via a property override. `Terminate` is the AWS default and is the correct posture: if the function ever invokes itself or sets up a self-triggering chain (Lambda → SNS → Lambda, etc.), Lambda will detect the loop and terminate after a small number of iterations. Setting it in code rather than relying on the runtime default makes the choice visible in review.

**Lambda environment variables are CMK-encrypted** — `environment_encryption=self.encryption_key` is set on the `PythonFunction` so env vars at rest are encrypted with the project's CMK rather than Lambda's default AWS-managed key. Without this, the security boundary spans two keys: the AWS-managed one for env vars, and our CMK for everything else (logs, DynamoDB, etc.). Pinning to one key keeps the auditable surface small and means `kms:Decrypt` on a single ARN is the entire blast radius for env-var compromise.

**AppConfig hosted configuration content is CMK-encrypted** — `kms_key_identifier=self.encryption_key.key_arn` is set on the `CfnConfigurationProfile`, so the feature-flag JSON stored by AppConfig is encrypted at rest with the same CMK as the rest of the backend (logs, DDB, env vars). `KmsKeyIdentifier` on `AWS::AppConfig::ConfigurationProfile` was a later AWS addition that some older CDK reference projects still claim isn't available — it is, and it composes with the rest of this stack's KMS posture rather than leaving a feature-flag store on an AWS-managed key. Per the [AppConfig data-protection docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/data-protection.html), the *caller's* IAM role (not a service principal) needs `kms:Encrypt`/`Decrypt`/`GenerateDataKey*` on the key. The Lambda role already has all of those via the DynamoDB and Lambda env-var grants, so no IAM additions were required when CMK-encryption was wired up.

**Powertools log level uses one knob, not two** — only `POWERTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL` is set; the legacy `LOG_LEVEL` fallback is intentionally not. Powertools 3.x prefers `POWERTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL` and falls back to `LOG_LEVEL` for backward compat — running both side-by-side hides which knob actually wins, especially during a future deploy where someone updates one but not the other. Keeping a single source of truth means the answer to "why is the log level X?" is always the same env var.

**API Gateway cache cluster intentionally disabled** — the smallest cache cluster (0.5 GB) is ~$14/month for a sample app, and `GET /hello` would return stale values across SSM parameter or AppConfig feature-flag changes for the cache TTL window. The `NIST.800.53.R5-APIGWCacheEnabledAndEncrypted` finding is suppressed at the stack level with that rationale. Forks with high read volume on truly cacheable responses can flip it back on — both `cache_cluster_enabled=True` and `cache_data_encrypted=True` are the right defaults to restore together.

**Athena query results are SSE-KMS-encrypted via per-object override** — the access-log bucket's default encryption is SSE-S3 (because the S3/CloudFront log delivery service can't write to KMS-encrypted buckets), but Athena's `PutObject` calls override the bucket default on a per-object basis to write `athena-results/` objects with SSE-KMS using the frontend CMK. The bucket-default constraint only applies to objects S3 chooses the encryption for, not to objects whose caller specifies it. End result: the noisy log objects use SSE-S3, but every Athena query result file is CMK-encrypted alongside the rest of the project's data.

**CloudWatch log groups for the AwsCustomResource provider are pre-created with the project CMK** — the AwsCustomResource singleton, the BucketDeployment provider, and the S3 auto-delete provider all get explicit `LogGroup`s passed in via `log_group=` (rather than the legacy `log_retention=` path). This closes the `*-CloudWatchLogGroupEncrypted` finding without needing an Aspect-level suppression — every log group in the stack is owned by CDK and encrypted with the same CMK as the rest of the data, and `cdk destroy` removes them cleanly. The pattern lives in `attach_async_failure_destination()` and the explicit `BucketDeploymentLogGroup` / `AwsCustomResourceLogGroup` declarations in [hello_world/hello_world_app.py](hello_world/hello_world_app.py) and [hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py](hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py).

**AppInsights cleanup custom resource is scoped to one dashboard ARN** — the AppInsights service creates a CloudWatch dashboard outside CloudFormation, so a Lambda-backed `cr.AwsCustomResource` calls `DeleteDashboards` at destroy time. The earlier `AwsCustomResourcePolicy.ANY_RESOURCE` would have granted `cloudwatch:DeleteDashboards` on `*`; the policy is now scoped to `arn:{partition}:cloudwatch::{account}:dashboard/{resource_group.name}` so the CR can only delete the one dashboard it knows about. CloudWatch dashboards have a known global ARN format and the resource group name is fixed, so the ARN is computable at synth time without needing a custom-resource lookup.

**API Gateway CORS allows the `Idempotency-Key` header** — required because the Lambda enforces the header at the application layer. Both API Gateway's `add_cors_preflight(allow_headers=...)` and Powertools' `CORSConfig(allow_headers=...)` carry `Idempotency-Key` explicitly. Without the preflight permission the browser would block the actual request before it ever reaches the API. Future routes that need additional headers should extend both lists in lockstep.

**Feature flag evaluation is passed source IP and user agent context** — `feature_flags.evaluate(name=..., context={"source_ip": ..., "user_agent": ...}, default=False)`. Without `context=`, AppConfig's rule engine can't see the values to evaluate against — any IP-based or UA-based flag rule defined in AppConfig would silently never match. Forks adding new flag dimensions (region, customer tier, user ID) should extend the context dict at the same time they add the rule.

**Required env vars resolve from CFN refs rather than f-strings** — `APPCONFIG_APP_NAME` / `APPCONFIG_ENV_NAME` / `APPCONFIG_PROFILE_NAME` are sourced from `self.app_config_app.name`, `app_config_env.name`, `app_config_profile.name` rather than from `f"{stack.stack_name}-features"` string formatting. The CFN-ref form keeps the Lambda's reads in lockstep with the IAM grant: any future rename of the AppConfig resources flows through `.name` automatically, instead of needing two changes (the construct definition and the env-var literal) to stay consistent.

**SSM `get_parameter` uses a 5-minute in-memory cache** — `get_parameter(GREETING_PARAM_NAME, max_age=300)` raises Powertools' default 5-second TTL to 300 seconds. The greeting changes via deployment, not at runtime, so the longer TTL is safe and meaningfully cuts SSM API calls per warm container. Forks pulling truly dynamic values should drop `max_age` back to the default.

**AppConfig fallback exception list is narrow, not broad** — the feature-flag evaluation's `except` clause catches only `(ConfigurationStoreError, SchemaValidationError, StoreClientError)` from `aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.feature_flags.exceptions`. A bare `except Exception` would also absorb programming errors (TypeError, AttributeError) introduced by future code edits to the rule engine — those should surface as bugs in metrics rather than silently fall back to the default. New downstream calls should pick the same shape: catch the specific service-side exception types, let everything else propagate.

**CloudTrail S3-data-events bucket has a 30-day lifecycle** — the trail bucket previously had no lifecycle rule and would have grown unbounded; data events fire on every Get/Put/Delete against the audited buckets. 30 days matches a typical short-retention forensic window. Production forks under HIPAA/PCI scope should extend (or replace) this with an AWS Backup plan or a longer S3 lifecycle.

**`cdk.json` `_skipped_` flags document the non-trivial rejections** — flags that produce real template drift on this stack (e.g. `@aws-cdk/aws-iam:standardizedServicePrincipals`, verified locally) live in `cdk.json` as documented `_skipped_` entries rather than getting silently flipped on. The convention is: safe-flags (zero template drift) get enabled; flags that emit drift get a `_skipped_` entry naming the reason, so a future "should we enable this?" review starts from documented context instead of re-running the synth comparison from scratch.

**Glue Data Catalog encryption was implemented and then deliberately reverted** — the stack briefly configured `AWS::Glue::DataCatalogEncryptionSettings` to encrypt catalog metadata and connection passwords with the frontend KMS key. Two reasons it was removed:

1. **Account/region-wide blast radius.** There is exactly one Glue Data Catalog per account per region, not one per stack. The encryption settings resource configures *that one shared catalog*. Deploying this reference architecture into an account that already has other teams using Glue would either silently override their settings or fail outright if their key policy rejects the change. For a repository whose explicit purpose is to be forked and dropped into existing AWS accounts, that's a footgun.
2. **The encrypted data has no realistic confidentiality requirement.** What's actually inside this stack's catalog: table definitions for `cloudfront_logs` and `s3_access_logs` with column names like `log_date`, `x_edge_location`, `c_ip`. These match the public CloudFront and S3 access-log schemas — anyone can look up the column list in AWS docs. There are no Glue connections, no JDBC sources, and therefore no connection passwords to protect. Encrypting non-sensitive metadata against a non-existent threat is checkbox security.

If you fork this and your catalog will hold genuinely sensitive table metadata (custom analytics tables for PII, partner data, etc.), wire `glue.CfnDataCatalogEncryptionSettings` into a **separate, intentionally account-scoped** stack rather than into a per-application stack — that way the account-wide nature of the resource is reflected in the deploy boundary, and forks of this app can't accidentally mutate it.

**WAF AntiDDoSRuleSet was implemented and then deliberately reverted** — `AWSManagedRulesAntiDDoSRuleSet` was added at WebACL priority 1 with `UsageOfAction=ENABLED` to provide application-layer DDoS protection. The first deploy attempt failed because I'd referenced a hallucinated rule group name (`AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpDDoSList`), which doesn't exist; the second deploy with the real rule group failed because AntiDDoSRuleSet requires a `ManagedRuleGroupConfig` with a `ClientSideActionConfig` declared; the third deploy with that config failed because `UsageOfAction=ENABLED` requires at least one regex in `ExemptUriRegularExpressions`, and this stack has no URIs to legitimately exempt. By the time we'd worked through the constraints, the cost picture was clearer:

| Charge | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Entity activation fee | **$20.00 / month** per WebACL using the rule group | Verified against the AWS pricing catalog (`/offers/v1.0/aws/awswaf/current/index.json`, group "AMR Anti-DDoS Entity") |
| Standard rule fee | $1.00 / month | Each managed rule group counts as one of the WebACL's rules |
| Per-request inspection fee | $0.15 / million requests | On top of the standard $0.60 / million inspection fee |

The other 5 rules in the WebACL (IP Reputation, CRS, Known Bad Inputs, Anonymous IP List, custom rate limit) are all AWS WAF "free-tier" — no entity fee, just $1/month per rule. Only four paid-tier rule groups exist: Bot Control, ATP, ACFP, and AntiDDoSRuleSet. Adding AntiDDoSRuleSet would have raised this stack's fixed WAF cost from $10/month to $31/month — a similar jump in fixed WAF cost for one rule whose effective enforcement (the `DDoSRequests` Block arm) is gated on AWS observing high-confidence DDoS classification, which is unlikely to fire on a Hello World demo's traffic profile. The existing per-IP rate-limit rule already covers crude L7 DDoS at 200 req/5min/forwarded IP. Same conclusion as the Glue catalog encryption entry above: high cost, low value at this scale, document and skip.

If you fork this for a workload with real traffic and a realistic DDoS threat model, the rule group is genuinely useful — but treat the $20/month entity fee plus the exempt-URI-list requirement as planning items rather than drop-in additions.

**CloudFront cache invalidation is decoupled from `BucketDeployment`** — the `s3deploy.BucketDeployment` construct accepts a `distribution=` parameter that auto-invalidates the CloudFront cache after each upload. The convenient-looking parameter has a known bug ([aws/aws-cdk#15891](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/15891)): the construct's invalidation hook fires on *every* CFN lifecycle event, including Delete. On `cdk destroy`, that delete-time invalidation races with CloudFront's own deletion, surfacing as either "Unable to confirm cache invalidation was successful" (CloudFront returns ambiguous status while it's tearing itself down) or `AccessDenied on cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` (the IAM policy granting that permission was already deleted by CFN in the parallel teardown).

The fix is structural: drop `distribution=` from the `BucketDeployment` and replace it with a separate `cr.AwsCustomResource` that defines **`on_create` and `on_update` only — no `on_delete`**. CFN simply removes the resource from stack state during teardown without making any CloudFront API call. There's nothing to race with.

The non-obvious detail is the `CallerReference` value in the `CreateInvalidation` parameters. CloudFormation decides whether to fire `on_update` by comparing the resource properties JSON between deploys; if the JSON is identical, it skips the resource entirely. A static string would mean invalidations only fire on the very first deploy and never again — silently broken. The right value is `Fn.select(0, bucket_deployment.object_keys)`, which resolves at deploy time to the BucketDeployment's content-hashed S3 asset key. Same frontend assets → same key → same JSON → CFN sees no change → no invalidation fires (correct: nothing to invalidate). Different assets → different key → different JSON → CFN fires `on_update` → invalidation runs. As a bonus, backend-only deploys leave the frontend asset key unchanged, so they don't burn through the [1,000 free invalidation paths per AWS account per month](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/) for no reason.

The pattern matches the three other `AwsCustomResource` blocks already in this stack (`AppInsightsDashboardCleanup`, `RumExtendedMetrics`, `RumMetricsDestination`), so it doesn't introduce a new abstraction; it just applies the existing one to the BucketDeployment's invalidation hook.

### Scaling beyond a reference architecture

This project is a single-developer sample. AWS publishes broader guidance in [Best practices for scaling AWS CDK adoption within your organization](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/best-practices-for-scaling-aws-cdk-adoption-within-your-organization/) — most of which (private Construct Hubs, golden pipelines, multi-account strategies, Internal Developer Platforms, communities of practice) is org-scale guidance that doesn't apply at this size. The notes below capture which of that post's recommendations are already in place, which were analyzed earlier and skipped, which are worth flagging if you fork this for a real workload, and which are simply N/A.

#### Already in place

| Recommendation | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| **cdk-nag with custom Aspects** for org-specific policy enforcement | Five-pack `apply_compliance_aspects` aspect, see [CDK security checks](#cdk-security-checks) |
| **cdk-monitoring-constructs** for dashboards and alarms | Wired through `MonitoringFacade` covering Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB |
| **CDK code held to application-code quality standards** | ruff, mypy, pylint, bandit, pip-audit all run via pre-commit and CI |
| **Automated CI/CD with policy gates** | GitHub Actions runs `cdk synth` (which runs cdk-nag) on every PR, blocks merge on findings |

#### Already analyzed and skipped

- **`cdk-validator-cfnguard`** / cfn-guard plugin layer — see [Why cdk-nag and not cfn-guard or Checkov](#why-cdk-nag-and-not-cfn-guard-or-checkov) for the full comparison. Adding it on top of cdk-nag would duplicate compliance content with no unique rule coverage gained.

#### Worth flagging if forked for a real workload

These are gaps surfaced by an audit pass against AWS public documentation that I deliberately did *not* implement, because each one is either an intentional sample-app trade-off or a workload-specific decision better made at fork time:

- **WAF logging — no `redacted_fields` or `logging_filter`.** Per the [`CfnLoggingConfiguration` reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.cfn_property_mixins.aws_wafv2/CfnLoggingConfigurationMixinProps.html), WAF logs include full request headers, body, and URI by default. If your fork ever accepts an `Authorization` header, a session cookie, or a body field with PII, that lands in the WAF log group unredacted. Wire `redacted_fields=[{single_header: {name: "authorization"}}, {single_header: {name: "cookie"}}, ...]` so they're scrubbed before logging. Separately, `logging_filter` lets you drop ALLOW logs and keep BLOCK/COUNT/CAPTCHA so the volume is proportional to threat traffic — relevant once paid traffic actually hits the WAF.

- **API Gateway endpoint reachable bypassing CloudFront WAF.** The `execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com` URL is published in the `HelloWorldApiOutput` CfnOutput and bypasses your CloudFront-only WebACL. Per [Protect your REST APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-protect.html) and the [origin-security blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enhance-amazon-cloudfront-origin-security-with-aws-waf-and-aws-secrets-manager/), the two AWS-supported fixes are (a) attach a regional WAF ACL to the API too, or (b) have CloudFront inject a custom secret header from Secrets Manager and add an API Gateway resource policy that denies any request without it. Trade-off: option (b) requires a custom CloudFront origin response and a Secrets Manager rotation Lambda.

- **CloudFront Strict-Transport-Security header missing.** The CDK `SECURITY_HEADERS` managed policy sets X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-XSS-Protection — but **not** HSTS. Per the [CloudFront controls reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/cloudfront-rules.html), HSTS is recommended. Build a custom `ResponseHeadersPolicy` that includes both the existing four and `strict_transport_security` (e.g., `max-age=31536000`, `include_subdomains=True`).

- **AppConfig Lambda extension not used.** Per [Using AWS AppConfig Agent with AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions.html), the agent caches configurations in-process, polls in the background, and serves them via `localhost:2772` — reducing both AppConfig API spend and cold-start latency. Powertools' `AppConfigStore` does in-memory caching too, so the gain is smaller than for raw API users; still the AWS-recommended pattern for high-throughput functions.

- **Lambda reserved concurrency not set.** Per [Configuring reserved concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html), reserved concurrency caps a function so it can't (a) saturate downstream resources or (b) starve other functions in the account by consuming the 1000-concurrency pool. The `NIST.800.53.R5-LambdaConcurrency` finding is currently suppressed; for production, set `reserved_concurrent_executions=` to an explicit ceiling.

- **DynamoDB `deletion_protection_enabled` not set.** Per the [DynamoDB deletion-protection docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/help-panel/amazondynamodb/latest/console/hp-deletion-protection.html), this is recommended for important tables. The idempotency table uses `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` because this is a sample app; for production, switch *both* together — `deletion_protection_enabled=True` paired with `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`.

- **API Gateway throttling not configured.** `Serverless-APIGWDefaultThrottling` is suppressed. Per [Throttle requests to your REST APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-request-throttling.html), explicit per-stage rate + burst limits cap *total* RPS and protect the Lambda from runaway clients. The WAF rate limit is per-IP — stage throttling is the account-wide layer.

- **API Gateway request validation not configured.** `AwsSolutions-APIG2` is suppressed. Powertools' `enable_validation=True` validates at the Lambda layer, so malformed requests still cost a Lambda invocation. Adding API Gateway request models rejects invalid input before it reaches the function.

- **CloudWatch RUM session sample rate is 100%.** Fine for low-traffic; per the [RUM authorization docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-get-started-authorization.html) and [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/), dial it down at scale (RUM is billed per ingested event). 5–10% is a common production starting point.

- **Athena workgroup `MinimumEncryptionConfiguration` is enforced via `enforce_work_group_configuration=True`, not the dedicated property.** Per the [Athena workgroup minimum-encryption docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-minimum-encryption.html), the dedicated `MinimumEncryptionConfiguration` field gives belt-and-suspenders enforcement even when overrides are allowed. CDK 2.248's L1 `CfnWorkGroup` doesn't expose that field directly; achieving the same effect requires a property override on the underlying CFN resource. The current setup (`enforce_work_group_configuration=True` + `EncryptionOption=SSE_KMS`) prevents per-query overrides at this workgroup specifically — which is project-scoped, not account- or region-scoped — so for a sample app it's equivalent.

- **CloudTrail multi-region management trail.** The trail in this stack is regional and S3-data-events-only by design. Per [WKLD.07](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/aws-startup-security-baseline/wkld-07.html), production accounts should also have a separate management-event multi-region trail capturing IAM/STS/KMS calls — typically deployed at the org/account level rather than per-app.

- **CloudWatch Logs retention is 7 days everywhere.** Sample-app default. For production, the [CloudTrail security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/best-practices-security.html) and most compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI) require 1-year minimum retention on audit logs.

- **[`cdk-wakeful`](https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-wakeful)** — an alerting layer on top of `cdk-monitoring-constructs`. The current `MonitoringFacade` creates dashboards and alarms but the alarms aren't wired to anything — nobody gets paged on a 5xx spike or Lambda error rate. cdk-wakeful auto-routes alarms to SNS, with built-in integrations for AWS Chatbot and SSM Incident Manager. Single-line CDK change to enable. Cost: an SNS topic + subscription (negligible). Real win if the stack is going to be operated; pointless if it's a portfolio piece nobody monitors.

- **AWS Config conformance packs deployed via CDK** — different *timing* layer from cdk-nag: cdk-nag is preventive at synth time, Config is detective at runtime. Catches drift introduced after deploy (someone disables KMS via console, a new resource type that an Aspect rule doesn't yet cover, IAM policy expansion via service-linked roles). Could live as a sibling stack `HelloWorldComplianceStack` deploying an `AWS::Config::ConformancePack` referencing one of AWS's published templates ([Operational Best Practices for HIPAA Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/operational-best-practices-for-hipaa_security.html), Operational Best Practices for FedRAMP, etc.). Fits the existing "synth-time + runtime + access-log analytics" theme. Cost: Config has per-rule-evaluation pricing that scales with resource count, plus the configuration recorder itself.

- **CloudFormation Hooks for post-synthesis validation** — defensive *during stack operations*, not at synth or runtime. Catches the case where someone bypasses CI and pushes raw CloudFormation to the API directly (e.g., a misconfigured deploy script, a manually-crafted change set). Implementation is substantial — Hooks are a separate registry resource type with their own Python handler and deploy infrastructure. For a single-developer reference architecture this is meaningful complexity for marginal benefit; the realistic threat model here is the developer's own pre-commit hooks, not adversarial CFN injection. More compelling in a multi-team org where multiple roles have CFN deploy permissions.

- **[ggshield](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield)** for full-history secret scanning — the existing `detect-private-key` pre-commit hook catches private keys at commit time on the staged diff. ggshield is GitGuardian's CLI/pre-commit equivalent for ~400 secret types (cloud API keys, OAuth tokens, database URIs, JWT signing secrets), and it can scan the *entire* git history rather than just the next commit. Requires a free GitGuardian account for the API token; the pre-commit integration is two lines once the token is in a local secret store. Worth adopting any time the repo starts carrying real secrets (deploy roles, Sentry DSNs, partner API keys) where a one-commit oversight would otherwise be permanent.

- **[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) as a Dependabot replacement** — see [Why not Renovate?](#why-not-renovate) for the full comparison. Worth revisiting if a fork wants either (a) Renovate's [post-upgrade tasks](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#postupgradetasks) — they regenerate `lambda/requirements.txt` in the same PR commit as the `uv.lock` bump, eliminating the manual `make lock` push currently required for `lambda`-group updates — or (b) richer cross-package grouping (regex-based, per-manager overrides) beyond what Dependabot's grouped-updates ecosystem currently supports.

- **[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) envelope for asynchronous event payloads** — the CNCF event-format spec defines a standard set of attributes (`id`, `source`, `specversion`, `type`, `datacontenttype`) so heterogeneous producers and consumers can interoperate. Not relevant for the current synchronous API path; clearly relevant the moment a fork introduces fan-out (EventBridge → Lambda, SNS → SQS, Kinesis pipelines, S3 event notifications). AWS EventBridge supports [direct CloudEvents emission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-cloudevents.html), and shaping producer payloads to the schema up front avoids a per-consumer adapter for every new event type later.

#### Skip — N/A at this scale

- **Private Construct Hub**, approve-and-publish model for constructs, golden pipelines (centrally-managed, immutable from workload teams), ITSM approval integration, multi-account strategy with cross-account pipelines, Internal Developer Platforms (Backstage / Humanitec / Port), Communities of Practice, value-stream team alignment, multi-region deployment — all assume an org with multiple workload teams sharing a platform-engineering function. None apply to a single repo with one author.

- **CDK Pipelines** specifically (replacing GitHub Actions with `pipelines.CodePipeline`): doesn't add capability — same build/test/deploy outcome — but costs ~$1/month per pipeline + CodeBuild minutes and migrates a working setup. Worth considering only if you specifically want a CDK-native, in-code pipeline definition that lives alongside the stacks; otherwise GitHub Actions is fine and free.

- **CodeGuru Security / CodeWhisperer** for CDK code analysis: overlaps Bandit (already wired) and the editor-side AI assistant. Both add per-line scanning costs and produce findings the existing pipeline already covers. Optional polish, not a gap.

### AWS services for post-deployment operations

The in-stack [Monitoring](#monitoring) section covers what's wired into the CDK stacks themselves (CloudWatch dashboards, alarms via `cdk-monitoring-constructs`, RUM, X-Ray, access-log analytics via Athena). The services below are the *account-level* operational layer that complements it — security findings, compliance evidence, cost analysis, ML-driven anomaly detection, runbook automation, and incident response. None of them are wired into this repo today; this section is a forward-looking inventory for anyone forking this for a real workload.

#### Alerting and incident response

- **AWS Chatbot** — bridges AWS service notifications (CloudWatch alarms, AWS Health events, Security Hub findings, GuardDuty alerts, CodePipeline status, Config rule changes) to **Slack channels**, Microsoft Teams, and Amazon Chime via SNS. Single SNS topic + one Chatbot configuration per channel; no custom Lambda required. Pairs naturally with [`cdk-wakeful`](#scaling-beyond-a-reference-architecture) for the in-stack alarm side.
- **AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager** — incident response orchestration: on-call rotations, escalation plans, response plans that auto-trigger runbooks, contact channels (SMS / voice / email / Slack via Chatbot). Wires into CloudWatch alarms or EventBridge rules. Charges per response plan execution + notification fees.
- **AWS Health Dashboard** — service-health events, planned maintenance, and account-specific issues (e.g., "your Lambda function in us-east-1 may be affected by Service Event X"). Free, surfaced via EventBridge for routing to Chatbot / SNS / SSM Incident Manager. Often skipped in greenfield setups and missed when an outage hits.
- **AWS Systems Manager Automation** — runbook engine for routine ops (patch, restart, snapshot, remediate non-compliant resources, copy logs). Hundreds of AWS-managed runbooks; you can author your own in YAML/JSON. Combines well with EventBridge rules to auto-remediate Config or Security Hub findings.

#### Cost and rightsizing

- **AWS Cost & Usage Report (CUR)** — granular hourly billing data (per-resource, per-tag, per-pricing-dimension) delivered to S3, queryable via Athena. The detailed alternative to Cost Explorer for chargeback, financial-team integration, and trend analysis. Free to enable; you pay for the S3 storage + Athena queries.
- **AWS Compute Optimizer** — ML-driven rightsizing recommendations for Lambda (memory tuning, provisioned-concurrency suggestions), EC2 (instance type), EBS, ECS on Fargate, RDS. Free for the basic tier. Often surfaces 20-40% cost savings on undersized Lambda memory configurations on the first scan. Worth enabling for any production stack with non-trivial Lambda traffic.
- **AWS Trusted Advisor** — cost / security / performance / fault tolerance / service-limit checks. The free tier ships seven core checks; the full ~110-check set requires Business or Enterprise Support. Findings are exposed via the Trusted Advisor console, EventBridge, and the Support API.
- **AWS Support API** — programmatic access to support cases, Trusted Advisor checks, and AWS Health events. Requires **Business Support tier or higher** ($100/month minimum). Useful when integrating Trusted Advisor findings or AWS Health events into custom dashboards or CI gates.

#### Security findings and threat detection

| Service | What it detects | Timing | Cost model |
|---------|-----------------|--------|------------|
| **AWS Inspector** | Software vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Lambda code, container images, and EC2 OS packages | Scans on resource creation/change + continuous re-scan | Per-resource scanned per month (~$1.50 / Lambda function / month, ~$0.09 / image scan) |
| **AWS GuardDuty** | *Threats* — anomalous API behavior, compromised credentials (`UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/`), malware on EC2/EBS, unusual traffic patterns, S3 anomalies | Continuous, ML-based on VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, DNS logs | Per GB of analyzed events; ~$3-15/month for a small account |
| **AWS Detective** | *Investigation aid* — graph-database analysis of GuardDuty/Security Hub findings, post-incident forensics | Triggered by an existing finding; not a detector itself | Per GB of ingested log data; only useful after Inspector/GuardDuty are already running |
| **AWS Shield** | DDoS attacks at L3-L7 | Always on for CloudFront/Route 53/ELB (Standard tier, free); managed mitigation team + cost protection requires Advanced ($3,000/month) | Standard: free. Advanced: $3,000/month flat plus traffic |

Short version of the "vs" question: **Inspector** = "what packages am I running with known CVEs"; **GuardDuty** = "is someone or something acting suspiciously in my account"; **Detective** = "this finding looks bad, show me everything related to it for the last 90 days"; **Shield** = "block volumetric DDoS traffic before it hits my origin." They compose — most production accounts run Inspector + GuardDuty as the detection layer, Detective as the investigation layer, Shield Standard automatically. Shield Advanced is reserved for high-stakes public-facing workloads.

- **AWS Security Hub** — the *aggregator*: pulls findings from Inspector, GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer, Macie, Firewall Manager, Health, Config, third-party tools, and applies the **Foundational Security Best Practices** + **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark** + **PCI DSS** + **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** standards. Single pane of glass with a normalized finding format (ASFF). Routes via EventBridge to Chatbot / SSM Incident Manager / your ITSM. The recommended starting point for any production account.

#### Compliance and audit

- **AWS Config and Conformance Packs** — see also [Scaling beyond a reference architecture](#scaling-beyond-a-reference-architecture). Config records resource configurations and evaluates managed/custom rules continuously; Conformance Packs are pre-built rule collections (HIPAA, FedRAMP, NIST, PCI, CIS, etc.) deployed as a single CFN template. Different *timing* layer from cdk-nag — synth-time prevention vs. runtime detection of drift.
- **AWS Audit Manager** — collects evidence continuously for **specific compliance frameworks** (FedRAMP Moderate / High, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR, NIST 800-53, etc.) and produces audit-ready reports. Pulls from Config, Security Hub, CloudTrail, IAM. Charges per assessment.

#### Resilience and chaos engineering

- **AWS Resilience Hub** — assess and improve workload resilience against defined RTO / RPO targets. Models failures across regions, AZs, and dependencies; recommends improvements (multi-AZ, backup plans, cross-region replication). Useful gate before declaring a workload "production-ready."
- **AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS)** — managed chaos engineering. Inject faults (kill instances, throttle APIs, simulate AZ failure, network impairment) on schedule or on-demand. Lower-effort entry point than DIY chaos with Toxiproxy/Chaos Mesh; integrates with Resilience Hub findings.

#### ML-driven anomaly detection

- **AWS DevOps Guru** — analyzes CloudWatch metrics, CloudTrail events, and (optionally) **CloudWatch Logs** for operational anomalies — surges, error-rate spikes, deployment-related regressions, IAM policy expansion, latency drift. Worth enabling with **log anomaly detection** on the Lambda log groups, **OpsItem creation** in Systems Manager OpsCenter (so anomalies become tracked tickets rather than dashboard noise), and the **cost estimator** (so you see the dollar impact of each anomaly when triaging). $0.0028/resource/hour after a free trial; meaningful spend at scale.
- **AWS Systems Manager Application Manager** — view-and-act dashboard scoped to "an application" (a CloudFormation stack and any tag-grouped resources). Surfaces CloudWatch metrics, CloudWatch Logs Insights queries, Config compliance, OpsItems, runbook executions, and cost — all filtered to one application. To make this work end-to-end:
  1. Tag every resource (and the CloudFormation stack itself) with `AppManagerCFNStackKey: <stack-name>` so cost data lights up in Cost Explorer alongside the operational data.
  2. Set up an AWS Config configuration recorder in the account.
  3. Attach the relevant **Conformance Packs** so compliance status appears under the Application Manager application view.
  4. Wire **CloudWatch Logs Insights queries** as saved queries on the application's log groups for one-click log triage.

#### Self-service and inventory

- **AWS Resource Groups** — group resources by tag, CloudFormation stack, or query for cross-service operations (bulk apply Tags, run an Automation document over the group, scope an Application Manager view). Free; the underlying primitive that Application Manager and many service-catalog patterns build on.
- **AWS Service Catalog** — internal portfolio of approved CDK / CloudFormation / Terraform templates that workload teams can self-deploy from with parameter inputs. Often paired with Control Tower to give downstream teams a constrained "menu" of deployable stacks. Org-scale only — single-developer reference architectures don't benefit.

#### Reviews and assessment

- **AWS Well-Architected Tool** — guided workload reviews against the six pillars (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, sustainability) plus optional lenses (Serverless, SaaS, ML, etc.). Produces an improvement plan with prioritized remediations. Free; recommended before any "production-readiness" sign-off.

#### CloudTrail in new accounts (always)

For any AWS account that doesn't already have an org-level trail: **enable AWS CloudTrail with a multi-region trail that delivers to CloudWatch Logs**, in addition to its default S3 destination. The CloudWatch Logs destination is what makes anomaly detection (DevOps Guru, Security Hub, GuardDuty, custom EventBridge rules) work in real time — the S3-only flow is too high-latency for alerting. Reference: [Datadog's coverage of the underlying detection rule](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/default_rules/def-000-bop/).

#### What *not* to wire up

- **Amazon QuickSight for CloudFront / S3 access-log visualization** — **don't.** QuickSight charges $24/user/month for Reader (capacity) plus per-session fees, and the visualizations it produces over access logs are achievable via Athena directly with no per-user license. The existing Glue catalog + Athena WorkGroup + named queries in the frontend stack already deliver the same insight for free. QuickSight is a fit only when you have a non-technical audience that needs interactive dashboards and BI-style drill-down — not for an engineering team querying access logs.
